# Suggested Study Plan (optional, can be done faster if you think you can)

The NASM CPT study plan systematically distributes the course content over 12 weeks of sequential chapter engagement, followed by three weeks of review. 

Each of these 12 weeks typically covers one to two chapters, with learners directed to read specific lessons, complete associated knowledge checks, and take chapter quizzes over several days. 

After completing logical groups of chapters (some sections are split over multiple weeks) Day 6 is dedicated to taking section review practice tests and using "consider the following" questions to synthesize what you learned. These questions are reproduced below.

Day 7 of every week is consistently reserved for catching up, reviewing challenging concepts, and noting progress. The final three weeks (Weeks 13-15) are then dedicated solely to overall certification review, practice exams, and scheduling the actual exam, with no new chapter content introduced.
