# Certified Personal Trainer Mission Statement
## Synthesized from NASM Course Foreword by Brian Sutton | MS, MA, NASM-CNC, CES, PES, CSCS | NASM Content and Production Manager

As a professional personal trainer, my mission is as follows:
- I help people live healthier, more empowered lives. 
- I optimize human potential and performance.
- Each client is unique in their health and fitness goals. I can train any client toward any goal.

I commit to learning and applying the latest evidence-based strategies, skills, and training techniques to guide my clients toward their goals safely, with integrity, and with lasting impact.

The NASM Optimum Performance Training® (OPT™) model is the backbone of this  process: a simple, proven framework for designing custom exercise programs that enhance each client’s ability to achieve real and lasting results.
