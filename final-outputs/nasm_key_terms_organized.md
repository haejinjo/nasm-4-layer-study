#### Lesson 1: Introduction: Strength-training Machines, Free Weights, and Cable Machines

- **Bilateral**: Relating to two sides of the body.
- **Circuit training**: As series of exercises performed one after another with minimal (or limited) rest.
- **Core stability**: The ability of an individual to maintain a given position, adequately stabilizing the spine while the extremities are moving.
- **Modalities**: Device or tools that are designed to enhance an exercise or movement to create a desired outcome by their inclusion. Examples include treadmill for cardiovascular health or dumbbells for strength and hypertrophy.
- **Motor learning**: Integration of motor control processes through practice and experience, leading to a relatively permanent change in the capacity to produce skilled motor behavior.
- **Planes of motion**: The planes of movement in which the human body moves, which includes the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.
- **Proprioception**: The body’s ability to naturally sense its general orientation and relative position of its parts.
- **Proprioceptively enriched environment**: An unstable (yet controllable) exercise environment that causes the body to use its internal balance and stabilization mechanisms.
- **Stability**: The resistance to the external disruptions to one’s equilibrium.
- **Superset**: Two exercises performed back to back in rapid succession with minimal to no rest.
- **Unilateral**: Relating to one side of the body.

#### Lesson 2: Elastic Resistance and Medicine Balls

- **Antirotational exercises**: Core exercises performed in a manner in which the exerciser resists forces that cause torso rotation; often unilateral in nature.
- **Asymmetrical resistance loading**: Unequal or uneven resistance force. Examples include using different loads for each extremity or performing unilateral exercises.
- **Lumbar spine**: The lumbar region of the spine, more commonly known as the low back, which consists of five vertebrae labeled L1–L5.
- **Thoracic spine**: Composed of 12 vertebral bodies (T1–T12) that make up the midregion of the spine. Attached to the rib cage at each level of the thoracic spine providing stability and structural support.

#### Lesson 3: Kettlebell and Bodyweight Training

- **Kinesthetic awareness**: The awareness of the body’s position as it moves through multiple planes of motion.
- **Suspended bodyweight training**: A form of resistance training that uses a system of ropes and webbing that allows the user to work against their own body weight while performing various exercises.

#### Lesson 4: Sandbags, ViPR, and Battle Ropes

- **Loaded movement training**: Adding additional weight or load to dynamic, full-body, multiplanar movements.

#### Lesson 5: Introduction to Proprioceptive Modalities

- **Perturbation**: An alteration of the body’s current state caused by the application of an external force.

### Chapter 23: Chronic Health Conditions and Special Populations

#### Lesson 1: Age Considerations

- **Arteriosclerosis**: A general term that refers to the hardening and loss of elasticity of arteries.
- **Atherosclerosis**: The processes by which plaque is formed in arteries leading to reduced blood flow.
- **Mortality**: A state or a risk of death or dying.
- **Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+)**: A detailed questionnaire designed to assess an individual’s physical readiness to engage in structured exercise.
- **Proprioception**: The body’s ability to naturally sense its general orientation and relative position of its parts.
- **Valsalva maneuver**: A process that involves expiring against a closed windpipe, creating additional intra-abdominal pressure and spinal stability.

#### Lesson 2: Obesity

- **Adherence**: The level of commitment to a behavior or plan of action.
- **Obesity**: A complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat; classified by a body mass index of 30 or greater.
- **Overweight**: A body weight greater than what is considered within normal standards; a body mass index of 25.0 to 29.9.

#### Lesson 3: Diabetes

- **Diabetes**: Chronic metabolic disorder, caused by insulin deficiency, which impairs carbohydrate usage and enhances usage of fat and protein.
- **Hyperglycemia**: High blood sugar; the state of elevated glucose in the bloodstream.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar; the state of deficient glucose in the bloodstream.

#### Lesson 4: Hypertension and Coronary Heart Disease

- **Heart failure**: A condition in which the heart can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs.
- **Hypertension**: Consistently elevated blood pressure.
- **Kidney failure**: A sudden condition in which the kidneys cannot sufficiently filter waste from the blood and leads to renal failure.
- **Stroke**: A sudden lack of blood supply to the brain, caused by either a blockage in an artery or ruptured blood vessel.

#### Lesson 5: Osteoporosis and Arthritis

- **Arthritis**: Chronic inflammation of the joints.
- **Atrophy**: The wasting away or decrease in size of body tissue.
- **Osteoarthritis**: Caused by degeneration of cartilage within joints.
- **Osteopenia**: Lower than normal bone density and a precursor to osteoporosis.
- **Osteoporosis**: A condition of reduced bone mineral density, which increases risk of bone fracture.
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: A degenerative joint disease in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissue.

#### Lesson 6: Cancer and Pregnancy

- **Cancer**: A group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.

#### Lesson 7: Chronic Lung Disease and Intermittent Claudication

- **Chronic obstructive lung disease**: The condition of altered airflow through the lungs, generally caused by airway obstruction as a result of mucus production.
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath or labored breathing.
- **Intermittent claudication**: The manifestation of the symptoms caused by peripheral arterial disease.
- **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**: A group of diseases in which blood vessels become restricted or blocked, typically as a result of atherosclerosis; also referred to as peripheral vascular disease.
- **Restrictive lung disease**: The condition of a fibrous lung tissue, which results in a decreased ability to expand the lungs.
