# SUMMARY

Postural, movement, and performance assessments are key components of the intake process for all clients. The results from these assessments will enhance the fitness professional’s ability to develop customized fitness programs to enhance a client’s health. The fitness professional should become comfortable identifying the three postural distortions (pes planus distortion and upper and lower crossed syndromes) as a part of a static postural assessment. The overhead squat (or in some cases, a modified overhead squat) should be used for clients and will inform the fitness professional about which additional movement assessments to administer. The movement impairments identified during these assessments can be matched with their causes to help develop an individualized fitness program with the goal of improving movement quality and efficiency. Further, when working with clients who have athletic goals, performance assessments may be used as baseline tests and to track progress.
