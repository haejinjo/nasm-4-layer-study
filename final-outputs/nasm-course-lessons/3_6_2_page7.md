# TRY THIS

Sit with poor posture, making sure your spine is hunched over. While hunched over, take a deep breath in and exhale. Now, repeat this while sitting upright. Notice how much easier it is to breathe while sitting upright. Keep this in mind when working with clients.

Abnormal breathing patterns can lead to a decreased functional capacity that may result in headaches, feelings of anxiety, fatigue, poor sleep patterns, and difficulty with exercise, as well as poor circulation. However, fitness professionals should not try to diagnose these problems, because that is beyond a fitness professionalâ€™s scope of practice. If a client presents with clearly abnormal breathing patterns, they should be referred to a medical professional for assistance. However, teaching clients to breathe **diaphragmatically** (i.e., through the stomach) can be beneficial for exercise performance.

# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

The diaphragm is a muscle found at the base of the lungs, and similar to other muscles, it can be strengthened. Upon inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, allowing lungs to expand. Upon exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and moves back upward. Proper breathing, also known as diaphragmatic breathing, allows the stomach to expand while keeping the chest relatively stable during slow inhalation through the nose. Chest breathing is the opposite and does not encourage efficient oxygen exchange.
