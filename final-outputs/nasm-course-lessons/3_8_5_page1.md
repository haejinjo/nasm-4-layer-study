# SUMMARY

Our bodies need a constant supply of energy to function properly, maintain health, and support physical activity. The food we eat is what provides our cells with the energy needed to survive, and exercise places unique demands on the energy production pathways. Before food can become a usable form of energy, it has to be converted into smaller units called substrates, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These substrate molecules are then converted into ATP, which is the energy currency of all cells.

Exercise is categorized by the intensity and duration of an activity. These two factors are inversely related so as intensity goes up, the duration for which that intensity can be maintained must go down. Metabolism refers to the production of energy via three pathways that dynamically adjust to supply ATP depending on the intensity and duration of an activity. The ATP-PC system generates energy very quickly for high-intensity, short-duration activities; glycolysis generates energy moderately quickly; and the oxidative system generates energy relatively slowly but for a long duration. These energy systems all contribute to some degree at different points during any activity.

### CHAPTER REVIEW

Bioenergetics is the study of the ways in which food is turned into energy in the form of ATP. These processes follow the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy is not destroyed but rather converted into different forms throughout the environment. Food is digested and eventually metabolized to create ATP, which is then broken down to release energy that allows muscles to contract and bodily processes to be maintained. ATP is the only source of energy used directly for muscle contraction (activity), so producing ATP is vital for being physically active.

The fuels for exercise are mainly glucose and free fatty acids, but protein and ketone bodies can also be used for energy under certain circumstances. There are three energy systems that generate energy (ATP) for muscle contraction, and they are distinguished by the rate at which they produce energy and the substrates that are used. The ATP-PC system takes a phosphate from a phosphocreatine molecule and attaches it to ADP to create ATP. Glycolysis exclusively uses carbohydrates in the form of glucose or glycogen to produce ATP relatively quickly. The oxidative system is the only energy pathway that can use all types of substrates—carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and ketone bodies—but it produces ATP relatively slowly.

During a steady-state activity, the rate at which energy needs to be produced is relatively constant. Steady-state activities are also characterized as being at least several minutes in duration. By comparison, intermittent or interval activities are always changing the rate of energy demand. Periods of high-intensity work require the ATP-PC system and glycolysis to provide the ATP needed, whereas during rest periods the oxidative pathway will contribute more to ATP production. Therefore, during interval training, all energy systems will contribute to ATP production at some point during the workout.

If the exercise intensity is moderately high and the duration is at least several minutes, the body will need to start breathing more to deliver more oxygen to the mitochondria to support the work of oxidative phosphorylation. This shift to a larger breathing volume during moderate intensity exercise is known as VT1. VT1 is also the point at which carbohydrates and fat contribute equally to energy production. However, if the exercise intensity continues to increase, the body will not be able to rely on oxidative metabolism and will shift to using anaerobic processes that no longer use free fatty acids as a substrate and rely more on carbohydrates. This shift in fuel utilization also means that more carbon dioxide will be produced. The carbon dioxide is a by-product that needs to be exhaled, and as a result, breathing rate will increase and consistent talking will become more difficult. This is VT2, which is important not only to deliver oxygen but also to exhale the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide being produced. Therefore, at VT1 a person needs to take in more air to supply more oxygen to the mitochondria, while at VT2 the body becomes more focused on exhaling carbon dioxide.
