## Content
- What are the results from my client’s fitness assessment? Does my client exhibit muscle imbalances, poor posture, or limited mobility?

	- Which forms of exercise does my client like and dislike? Am I integrating liked exercises for my client to foster a positive environment?

	- What exercise variables, such as sets, repetitions, or rest periods, should I use that best match my client’s abilities, goals, and phase of training?

	- What exercise modalities, such as free weights, elastic bands, or machines, are appropriate for my client based on my client’s goals and fitness level?

	- What is the appropriate frequency (days per week) and duration (time per session) of exercise sessions that should be used?

If the fitness professional can answer these questions consistently, it is likely the client is in good hands to reach their fitness goals in a safe and effective manner. If not, the fitness professional is possibly creating an inappropriate exercise program, which may cause injury or undue fatigue that could lead to **overtraining **or burnout (Walters et al., 2018). Conversely, by following specified protocols, risk factors can be mitigated, and the client can exercise in a safe and positive environment that is set up for success.

Fitness programming takes practice, but, as with anything, the more experience obtained working with a wide range of exercisers, the less challenging it becomes. The goal is to create unique exercise programs that are systematic and progressive so that consistent overload can occur and fitness goals can be met.

Additionally, it is recommended that the fitness professional adopt an integrated approach to program design that includes multiple forms of training, such as flexibility; cardiorespiratory; core; balance; plyometric; speed, agility, and quickness (SAQ); and resistance training (Bennell et al., 2012; Bhagyalakshmi et al., 2007; DiStefano et al., 2013; Eriksen et al., 2002; Ng et al., 2012). Using an integrated approach to program design can increase consistency and progression and minimize the risk of injury (Faude et al., 2018; Hislop et al., 2017; Padua et al., 2018).

In some instances, clients and fitness professionals may be tempted to use an overly simplistic approach to program design. For example, exercise programs may overemphasize particular factors, such as expending maximal calories for fat-loss goals or the development of speed and power to improve athletic performance. However, a well-rounded exercise program must be progressive and systematic and consider many variables, such as teaching proper movement patterns, improving mobility and stability of the **kinetic chain**, enhancing muscular and aerobic endurance, and reducing the likelihood of injury. In other words, exercise programming involves more than what we see at the surface, such as reducing body fat, gaining muscle mass, or increasing strength and power (Teyhen et al., 2014). This is known as the “iceberg effect” (**Figure 21: -1**).

## Program Design

Program design is an organizational structure of exercises with appropriate volume and intensity to attain a specific fitness or performance goal (Lorenz & Morrison, 2015). In other words, the fitness professional provides a road map and vital step-by-step processes, modifications, and parameters to follow based on client capabilities, limitations, and goals. To be successful in program design, the fitness professional must have a clear understanding of training plans and periodization.

### TRAINING PLANS

To accomplish objectives, training programs should be organized into a plan that involves using long-term and short-term goals. A **training plan** is a specific outline that a fitness professional uses to help meet the client’s goal.

## Key Terms

**Overtraining**
Excessive frequency, volume, or intensity of training, resulting in reduction of performance, which is also caused by a lack of proper rest and recovery.

**Kinetic chain**
A concept that describes the human body as a chain of interdependent links that work together to perform movement.

**Training plan**
The specific outline created by a fitness professional that details the form of training, length of time, future changes, and specific exercises to be performed.
