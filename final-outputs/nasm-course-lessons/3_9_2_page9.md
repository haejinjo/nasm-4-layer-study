### NEGATIVE ENERGY BALANCE

In situations where there is a planned calorie restriction for those seeking weight loss, protein requirements will increase to reduce or offset the loss of lean muscle mass. In planned caloric deficits, where carbohydrate and fat intake are reduced, amino acids may be oxidized to meet the bodyâ€™s energy needs through gluconeogenesis. As a consequence, there may be a loss of lean muscle mass due to the increased demand for gluconeogenesis to meet energy needs. In other words, when individuals consume fewer calories, they tend to lose both fat and muscle. The loss of muscle may be partly offset via an increase in dietary protein intake to replenish amino acids and restore nitrogen balance.

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

How much protein is recommended for weight- or fat-loss goals?

For clients who are seeking moderate weight or fat loss and are in a moderate calorie deficit, their protein intake should be above the RDA minimum of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day. As noted earlier, though, clients seeking individualized meal plans should be referred to a RD or other nutrition professional for further guidance.

### TRENDING PROTEIN RESEARCH

In the past, there were some fears that higher-protein diets could place a strain on kidney function, compromise bone density, and contribute to weight and fat gain. However, updated research on protein intake shows that for healthy individuals who have no diagnosis or history of existing kidney disease, consuming a higher-protein diet does not cause kidney disease (Antonio et al., 2016). For individuals who have a medical diagnosis or history of kidney disease, a lower-protein diet may help to preserve kidney function (Ko et al., 2017).

In any situation where a medical diagnosis of a client warrants specific nutrition interventions and dietary modifications, Certified Personal Trainers should refer the client to see an RD or a licensed nutrition professional for dietary advice. This highlights the importance of asking clients about their medical history and any pertinent medical issues during the initial assessment, prior to beginning a training protocol.

Updated research has also shown that higher levels of protein intake do not appear to compromise bone density. In studies with a high-protein diet combined with resistance training, the bone mineral density of the participants actually improved (Antonio et al., 2018; Kerstetter et al., 2005, 2011).

Similarly, recent research has shown that consuming a higher-protein diet does not necessarily lead to weight or fat gain, even when protein contributes to additional calories in the overall diet (Antonio et al., 2014). In some studies, an increase in lean protein coupled with resistance training has been shown to improve body composition, with an increase in lean body mass and a decrease in body fat (Antonio et al., 2015; Jager et al., 2017; Layman et al., 2005). This observation has been attributed to the higher **thermic effect of food (TEF) **for protein, as compared to the other two macronutrients (**Figure 9-3**).

## Key Terms
