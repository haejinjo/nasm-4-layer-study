## Content
## Recommendations

The most current public health guidelines on physical activity, which are based on scientific evidence, recommend adults engage in 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (i.e., brisk walking) to help improve their overall health and fitness and reduce their risk for developing numerous chronic diseases. The guidelines also recommend that if adults exceed 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity activity, then they will gain even more health benefits.

The guidelines presented represent physical activity guidelines for all adults, especially those who are currently sedentary or have little previous experience with exercise. If clients are not able to achieve the suggested minimal guidelines for cardiorespiratory training of 150 minutes per week (or 30 minutes, five times per week) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on at least 5 days per week, they can break it up into shorter increments, for example 10 minutes at a time, until 150 minutes per week is met.
