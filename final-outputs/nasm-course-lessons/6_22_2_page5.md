## Content
For hundreds of years, medicine balls have been considered one of the Four Horsemen of Fitness next to the Indian club, the dumbbell, and the wand (Jespersen & Potvin, 2002). Medicine balls are still popular today because they can be thrown, caught, and used to provide resistance for a variety of movements, in a variety of planes of motion, and at a variety of velocities. Medicine balls can be used like any other resistance implement to add load, such as the medicine ball squat (**Figure 22-1: 0**), or instability to an exercise, such as the medicine ball push-up (**Figure 22-1: 1**).

Medicine balls can be used with a variety of populations as part of a program to increase muscular strength, endurance, and power or, in some cases, to help rehabilitate from injury (Faigenbaum & Mediate, 2006, 2008). Personal training clients enjoy the versatility of medicine balls, whereas athletes often benefit from the dynamic power opportunities afforded by their ability to be thrown and caught. The ability to develop explosive power is one of the unique benefits of training with medicine balls because velocity of movement is critical to developing power.
