## Content
When goals are unrealistic, they can become a barrier by causing frustration and disappointment. Young males indicated unrealistic goals were a barrier to exercise due to perceived expectations of a young male’s physical ability. For example, if they attempt to exhibit a certain level of fitness and do not succeed, then goals are viewed as unrealistic, and they give up (Ashton et al., 2015). If an individual believes that they are not making sufficient progress, the exerciser may start to feel defeated and eventually discontinue the practice of exercise. The fitness professional has the expertise to assist clients with setting realistic **outcome goals**, such as appropriate body fat reduction or strength increases, but it is also important to set realistic and achievable **process goals**, like being physically active for a certain number of days per week or reaching a certain number of active minutes each day (**Table 3-1**).

**TABLE 3-1 Types of Goals**

| Goal Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Outcome goal | Place in top 10 in a 10K race |
| Process goal | Jog for 45 minutes, starting at 6:30 a.m. Monday–Friday |

Goals can become unrealistic when they are not objective, when too many goals are set at one time, when goals are not adjusted, and when people are forced to set goals (Weinberg & Gould, 2019a). These pitfalls can be avoided by setting specific goals and avoiding vague statements like “get more fit” or “be more active.” When people are new to goal setting, fitness professionals should limit them to one to two short-term goals in the beginning. Also, they should explain to clients that adjusting goals, both up and down, is part of the process, so that changes are not viewed as failures. Finally, they should not force clients to set goals if they are resistant. Helping clients set realistic goals will go a long way toward setting them up for success.

## Lack of Social Support

**Social support** refers to the intentional actions taken by people to assist others in achieving a specific behavior. A lack of social support can make it difficult for some people to participate in regular exercise, depending on the types of support that they need. People who do not have support may not be able to overcome other barriers to exercise, or they simply cannot participate regularly. Individuals without social support may lack the following advantages:

	- Encouragement to participate in exercise

	- Someone who can discuss the challenges of exercise

	- Transportation to a fitness facility

	- The ability to find accurate information on health and fitness

	- An exercise partner

## Social Physique Anxiety

**Social physique anxiety** is when individuals feel anxiety about their physical appearance or are insecure about how they look to others or how they believe others perceive their body (Hart et al., 1989; Portman et al., 2018). Fitness facilities are places where individuals who have never felt anxious about their appearance might suddenly feel physically inadequate. Reasons for this issue may be due to the social comparison they believe is taking place or the specific attire that many people wear during exercise, including tight-fitting clothes and/or clothing with minimal coverage.
