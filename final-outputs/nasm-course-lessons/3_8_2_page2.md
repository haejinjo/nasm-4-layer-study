## Content
The human body has several ways to generate ATP from ADP, which is a process called **phosphorylation**. The three main ways that phosphorylation is reached are known as the three metabolic pathways:

	- ATP-PC system

	- Glycolytic system (glycolysis)

	- Oxidative system (oxidative phosphorylation)

Depending on the intensity of an activity, each of the systems will shift in priority as to which is primarily supplying ATP; however, there is rarely a time where only one or another is active by itself. All three systems work together to fulfil the body’s total energy demand. The energy systems do not turn on and off in a linear fashion; rather, they operate more like dimmer switches. As the intensity of activity changes, the energy systems dynamically adjust in relation to one another to ensure energy needs are met. Even though one energy system might be contributing more than the others given a specific intensity of activity, the other two are still contributing in the background in some fashion.

This is best shown when looking at a graph of how the energy systems respond when the body is asked to perform a maximally intense activity for a long duration (**Figure 8-3**), such as running a few laps around a track at the fastest pace possible (hypothetically assuming the same maximal pace can be maintained for a few minutes). Recall that at rest and during low-intensity activity, free fatty acids provide most of the energy via the oxidative system. Then, when intensity increases (e.g., going from a standstill to an all-out sprint), the oxidative system cannot keep up, and the anaerobic processes kick into gear.

For the first 10–15 seconds, as the body transitions from low to high intensity, the **ATP-PC system** provides the most energy. As the ATP-PC begins to exhaust and taper off, glycolysis is already ramping up to take over the majority of the energy production duties, which it can support for around 2 minutes. And all the while, the oxidative system is ramping up, contributing greater and greater amounts until it eventually becomes the primary source of ATP production. The better a person’s cardiorespiratory fitness is, the more efficiently the oxidative system can support higher levels of intensity without having to rely as heavily on anaerobic processes.

## Key Terms

**Phosphorylation**
The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule, such as in the transfer of a phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate to create adenosine triphosphate.

**ATP-PC System**
An energy system that provides energy very rapidly, for approximately 10–15 seconds, via anaerobic metabolism.
