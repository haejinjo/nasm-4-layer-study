## Content
## Single-Leg Squat Assessment

The **single-leg squat assessment** evaluates dynamic posture, lower-extremity strength, balance, and overall coordination in a single-limb stance. This test should be used for clients who have performed well in the OHSA, or if the fitness professional is considering single-leg exercises in their programming (single-leg squats, pistol squats, step-ups, etc.). This test is an effective assessment of an individualâ€™s ability to balance, which is an important functional consideration for activities of daily living and exercise programming. This assessment should be avoided by clients who are at risk for falls or loss of balance or who are recovering from a lower- body injury.
