#### TRAINING TIP

When designing HIIT training programs, recognize that “effort” is a subjective measure (e.g., how hard I am pushing myself), whereas “intensity” is an objective measure (e.g., sprint time, load lifted), and they are not the same. If a workout does not provide adequate recovery between intervals, then the intensity of the workout has to decrease, even if the individual’s effort is at a maximum.

### TABATA TRAINING

Tabata is a type of HIIT training and was created by a Japanese scientist named Dr. Izumo Tabata (Tabata et al., 1996). The Tabata format involves performing a maximal effort interval lasting 20 seconds, followed by only 10 seconds of rest. The client performs a total of eight intervals, for a total of 4 minutes. This format has been shown to improve aerobic power and improvements in VO~2max~ (Viana et al., 2018).

However, a true Tabata format is rarely taught in health clubs. Dr. Tabata and his team of researchers performed their study using elite cyclists as subjects in which each interval was performed at approximately 170% of VO~2max~. Most fitness enthusiasts are incapable of performing or sustaining exercise at this intensity. Moreover, a true Tabata workout session would only last 4 minutes. However, variations of Tabata training are popular, in which intervals are still high intensity yet the participant can successfully complete the program. It is important for fitness professionals to select interval intensities that are appropriate for their clients and consider their client’s fitness level and tolerance to intense exercise.

### FARTLEK TRAINING

*Fartlek *is a Swedish term that translates to “speed play.” The goals of fartlek training are highly variable, targeting many different physiological systems (i.e., aerobic and anaerobic) by combin­ing different formats into one workout. It is often performed while running, but it can also be completed while cycling or swimming. Unlike steady-state or HIIT formats, Fartlek training is unstructured and combines low-, moderate-, and high-intensity efforts into one workout. Far­tlek training helps break the monotony often associated with one format of training.

## Enjoyment

**Enjoyment **refers to the amount of pleasure derived from engaging in a specific exercise or activity. Unfortunately, this component of exercise programming is often overlooked or not considered more seriously. Exercise adherence rates decline significantly when a specific mode of exercise is selected for a client before considering their personality type, previous exercise experiences, and other interests. If the mode of activity or exercise training program is not enjoyable to a client, it is highly likely that they will not adhere to the exercise program and therefore not achieve their personal health and fitness goals. A client is much more apt to continue with a program that is fun and challenging and includes a supportive environment than one that is dull and boring (Heisz et al., 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2019; Wininger & Pargman, 2003).

## Volume

**Volume **of exercise represents the total amount of work performed in each timeframe, typically 1 week. As mentioned previously, public health guidelines recommend adults accumulate 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity every week, or an equivalent mix of the two (Piercy et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2015).
