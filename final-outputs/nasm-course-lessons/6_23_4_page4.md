## Content
Core exercises in the standing position are preferred over supine core exercises. Some examples include performing standing cable iso-rotations (**Figure 23: -5**) or cobras in a standing position (**Figure 23: -6**). Use plyometric training with care for this population.

Resistance training should be performed primarily in a seated or standing position as well. Exercise training programs should be progressed slowly and performed in a circuit-style or peripheral heart action training system (see Chapter 20) to distribute blood flow between the upper and lower extremities. Fitness professionals should always ensure that clients with hypertension try to breathe normally and avoid the Valsalva maneuver or overgripping (squeezing too tightly) when using exercise equipment, as this can dramatically increase blood pressure. Fitness professionals should also monitor clients with hypertension carefully when rising from a seated or lying position, as they may experience dizziness.
