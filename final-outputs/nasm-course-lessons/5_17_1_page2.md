# Essential Concepts of Balance

The ability to maintain postural control or balance is a fundamental component of performance, injury resistance, and rehabilitation that follows an injury. Technically, balance can be defined as the ability to maintain one’s **center of gravity** within that person’s **base of support** (Pollock et al., 2000). The center of gravity is the approximate midpoint of the body; while the location may vary between individuals, it is typically located at the midportion of the trunk. The base of support represents the area beneath a person that consists of every point of contact made between the body and the support surface (i.e., the floor). For example, the width between the feet of a standing individual would define the base of support. If an individual is standing still, the center of gravity can move within the** ****limits of stability**, as found within the base of support (**Figure 17-1**). The limits of stability mean the area within which an individual can move one’s center of gravity without changing the base of support (i.e., moving the feet) without falling (Pollock et al., 2000).

Balance can be classified into static, semi-dynamic, and dynamic. **Static balance** applies to situations when an individual seeks to maintain postural control within a stationary position; for example, the individual is standing still on one foot. **Semi-dynamic balance** refers to instances when an individual seeks to maintain balance within a stationary limit of stability, yet the base supporting the body is in movement (e.g., individual riding on a skateboard). **Dynamic balance** occurs when a person seeks to maintain their center of mass over an ever-changing limit of stability; for example, the individual is running on uneven surfaces.

## Key Terms

**Center of gravity**
The approximate midpoint of the body; while the location may vary between individuals, it is typically located at the midportion of the trunk.

**Base of support**
The area beneath a person that consists of every point of contact made between the body and the support surface.

**Limits of stability**
The area within which an individual can move one’s center of gravity without changing the base of support (i.e., moving the feet) without falling.

**Static balance**
The ability to maintain the center of mass within the base of support in a stationary position, meaning no linear or angular movement.

**Semi-dynamic balance**
The ability to maintain the center of mass with a stationary base of support yet allowing movement for the base supporting the body.

**Dynamic balance**
The ability to maintain a center of mass over an ever-changing base of support.
