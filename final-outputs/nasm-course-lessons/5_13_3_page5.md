## Content
## How to Use the OPT Model

Chapters later in this text will be specifically dedicated to explaining the components of an integrated training program, which include the following:

	- Flexibility training

	- Cardiorespiratory training

	- Core training

	- Balance training

	- Plyometric (reactive) training

	- Speed, agility, and quickness training

	- Resistance training

Each of these chapters explains in detail how to realistically apply the information given. Because the OPT model is based on the science of integrated training, all five phases within the OPT model often use all forms of exercise previously listed. This is a far cry from traditional workouts that only incorporate generalized stretching, cardiovascular, and resistance exercise.

In addition, Chapters 21 through 23 are dedicated to program design strategies. Within these chapters, the fitness professional will learn the subtle details of the OPT model, ways to incorporate various types of exercise equipment, and how to design exercise programs for special populations (i.e., youth, seniors, pre- and postnatal parents) or clients with chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease).

In combination, this information should provide any individual with all of the tools necessary to become a skilled and well-rounded fitness professional.
