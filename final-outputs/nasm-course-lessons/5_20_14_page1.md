# SUMMARY

The information contained in this chapter provides fitness professionals with the essentials to design safe and effective resistance training programs for a variety of clients. Critical resistance training concepts explored within this chapter included principles of adaptation, progressive overload, principles of specificity, characteristics of strength development, and various types of training systems, implementation, and exercise progressions.

By adhering to the fundamental principles discussed within this chapter, fitness professionals can ensure that resistance training programs produce desired outcomes. Programs that fail to address these fundamental principles may increase risk of injury and lower exercise adherence.

### CHAPTER REVIEW

Many scientific concepts and practical application strategies for implementing resistance training programs have been explored. These concepts should be followed to minimize the risk of injury and enhance participant adherence to the program. These concepts include principles of adaptation, progressive adaptations from resistance training, acute variables of training, resistance training systems, safety, and the implementation of various resistance training exercises.

To achieve optimal training results, the body must adapt to specifically imposed demands and stresses. The ability to adapt to stress is known as the general adaptation syndrome, which includes three stages: alarm reaction, resistance development, and exhaustion.

In addition, different tissues in the body respond to different stresses as seen in the principle of specificity, or SAID principle. Training programs should provide a variety of intensities and stressors to optimize the adaptation of each tissue to ensure the best possible results. The degree of adaptation that occurs during training is directly related to the mechanical, neuromuscular, and metabolic specificity of the training program.

Resistance training programs produce physiologic changes that result in a variety of strength adaptations. Traditionally, resistance training programs focused on developing maximal strength in individual muscles, whereas contemporary training programs emphasize appropriate exercise selection, all muscle actions, multiple planes of motion, and repetition tempos. Training adaptations can be divided into stabilization, muscular endurance, hypertrophy, strength, and power.

Acute variables determine the amount of stress placed on the body and, ultimately, what adaptation the body will incur. The acute variables to consider when designing a resistance training program include repetitions, sets, training intensity, rest intervals, training volume, training frequency, training duration, exercise selection, and exercise order.

There are numerous training systems that can be used to structure a resistance training program for a variety of effects, including the single set, multiple set, pyramid, superset, complex, drop set, giant set, rest-pause set, circuit training, peripheral heart action, split routine, vertical loading, and horizontal loading systems.

The most important objective for fitness professionals is to commit to doing no harm to their clients. Consequently, safety measures, such as maintaining a safe environment, setting up equipment properly, using appropriate spotting techniques, and monitoring the five kinetic chain checkpoints should be followed.

Lastly, programming resistance training exercises must be systematic and progressive. As such, fitness professionals should follow specific program guidelines, including proper exercise selection criteria and milestones for progression.
