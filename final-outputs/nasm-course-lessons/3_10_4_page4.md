## Content
For those clients who are willing to push their physical limits, creatine helps them perform additional repetitions, increasing their training volume and, therefore, their stimulus for adaptation.

Creatine is a naturally produced (approximately 1 g/day) compound made from three amino acids: methionine, arginine, and glycine. It is produced by the liver and kidneys, but it is primarily stored in skeletal muscle where it is able to exert its primary function. Creatine works like a backup to ATP; it carries extra **phosphagen**, as creatine phosphate, which it uses to rephosphorylate ADP to ATP, allowing muscle fibers to continue strong contractions during approximately the first 15 seconds of exercise (**Figure 10-8**). After beginning to use creatine, clients may notice these effects manifest as greater exercise tolerance; for example, they are able to perform more repetitions at the same weight for a given exercise.

By far, the most substantiated form of creatine is **creatine monohydrate**, with more than 500 investigations on the compound. There are about a dozen forms of creatine supplements available, yet none have ever demonstrated superiority to creatine monohydrate (Jager et al., 2011). The most important factor to consider with creatine supplementation is dose, as this is often the most controversial point and an area containing misinformation.

Research on creatine supports use of 5 g per day, but those with greater-than-average muscle mass may require more—up to 10 g per day. Creatine does not need to be loaded, but it will begin working sooner if it is loaded, because it will take less time for muscles to become fully saturated (Kreider et al., 2017). A common **loading** strategy is to supplement with 20 g of creatine per day for 5 to 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g. Creatine does not need to be cycled (Rawson et al., 2004). It was once believed that chronic creatine supplementation would compromise **endogenous** production, but that has since been disproven (Kreider et al., 2017).

Creatine may be supplemented by those who want to gain muscle or weight in general, strength, power output, and tolerance for bouts of acute high-intensity exercise (Branch, 2003; Law et al., 2009; Rawson & Volek, 2003). While endurance athletes are often reluctant to use creatine for fear of weight gain, creatine supplementation has been shown to be effective for improving oxygen consumption and glycogen resynthesis with minor effects on endurance (Ayoama et al., 2003; Graef et al., 2009; van Loon et al., 2004). Those wishing to experience some benefits of creatine without significant weight gain may supplement with 2–3 g per day (specifically, 0.03 g/kg body weight) instead of 5 g (Rawson et al., 2011). It is important to highlight that the immediate weight gained from creatine can be attributed to water weight. Creatine does not rapidly cause weight gain in any other body tissue compartment, despite beneficial effects on muscle tissue over time.

A new area of creatine research is in the prevention of brain injury. While most creatine is stored in skeletal muscle, some creatine is stored in the brain, and supplementation with creatine increases brain stores as well.

## Key Terms

**Phosphagen**
