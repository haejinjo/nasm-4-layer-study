## Content
Assessment procedures should follow those outlined in Chapters 11 and 12. Flexibility exercises can be used as suggested; however, special care should be given to self-myofascial techniques, and this may be contraindicated for anyone with neuropathy (i.e., a loss of protective sensation in feet and legs). Advice from a licensed physician concerning self-myofascial techniques should be obtained as well as from a certified diabetes educator if clients are under the care of one, as it may be contraindicated. Integrated training programs are appropriate for this population; however, the use of plyometric training may be inappropriate.

# TRAINING TIP

Blood glucose levels can vary throughout the day, especially right before and right after eating a meal. Blood glucose levels are usually less than 100 mg/dL when fasting and less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating.

Hypoglycemia is a condition that occurs when blood glucose becomes too low to support normal physiological functioning. Symptoms of hypoglycemia generally occur when blood glucose levels fall below 70 mg/dL. Identifying signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia is the first step to help correct a hypoglycemic event. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include the following:

	- Fatigue

	- Pale clammy skin

	- Irregular heart rate

	- Sweating

	- Shaky, unstable feeling

	- Extreme hunger

If hypoglycemia symptoms worsen, signs and symptoms may include the following:

	- Confusion

	- Blurred vision

	- Possibility of seizures

	- Extreme irritability

Initial treatment of hypoglycemia is to consume simple sugar, such as juice, soda, or hard candy. If symptoms do not improve, the client should contact their physician or seek medical attention.
