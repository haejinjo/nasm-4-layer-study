## Content
Improved backside mechanics are associated with a stronger push phase, including hip-knee extension, gluteal contraction, and backside arm drive. Frontside and backside mechanics work in synchrony to apply force to the ground, recover from a stride cycle, and propel the body forward effectively. When executing either frontside or backside mechanics drills, it is essential to keep the pelvis in a neutral position to facilitate proper range of motion and force production (**Table 19-1**).

# HELPFUL HINT

**Triple flexion** includes ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, and hip flexion; the lead leg while sprinting. **Triple extension** includes ankle plantar flexion, knee extension, and hip extension; the rear leg while sprinting.

**TABLE 19-1 Kinetic Chain Checkpoints During Running Movements**

| Body Position | Comments |
|---|---|
| Foot/ankle complex | While sprinting forward, the foot and ankle should be pointing straight ahead in a dorsiflexed position when it hits the ground. Slight deviations (e.g., foot external rotation) are expected during multidirectional running and lateral shuffles. |
| Excessive flattening or external rotation of the foot will create abnormal stress throughout the rest of the body and decrease overall performance. |
| Knee complex | The knees must remain straight ahead. Avoid excessive knee valgus (i.e., knock knees). |
| If the athlete demonstrates excessive adduction and internal rotation of the femur during the stance phase, it decreases force production and may lead to overuse injuries. |
