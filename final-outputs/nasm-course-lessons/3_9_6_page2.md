## Content
If energy intake is less than energy expenditure, energy stored in the body will be used as fuel. Despite many proposed theories on weight loss and gain, this basic concept still holds true on a fundamental level. Weight loss requires a deficit of calories, and weight gain requires a surplus. Energy intake is primarily governed by the quantity and quality of food and beverages ingested by an individual. Some foods are calorically dense and can contribute to excess energy intake. Other foods, such as lean proteins, high-fiber whole grains, vegetables, and fruit, are not only nutritious but also less calorically dense than many hyperpalatable foods, which contain **added sugars** and fats. For example, an average orange has about 45 calories, whereas an orange smoothie (depending on the recipe and size) can have upwards of 200 to 500 calories.

Some studies have found that overall energy (calorie) intake on a whole-foods diet versus a processed-foods diet tends to be lower (Barr & Wright, 2010; Hall et al., 2019). Whole foods tend to be higher in fiber and protein and lower in added sugars than most processed foods, a possible reason for the difference. Whole foods, such as lean proteins, whole grains, legumes, and vegetables, may also be more **satiating** than many processed foods; again, this is due to the higher fiber and protein content and also likely due to flavor and freshness. Encouraging clients to choose a greater amount of whole foods while limiting highly processed foods in their diet may be one strategy to help them maintain caloric balance and avoid excess energy intake. When an individual’s **total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)** is equivalent to the client’s total energy intake, then body weight remains unchanged. Factors such as sleep, hormones, nonexercise, activity, and medications influence both sides of the energy equation.

### POOR SLEEP

Adults between the ages of 18 to 64 years old are recommended to get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night (National Sleep Foundation, 2015). However, many adults fall short of these guidelines. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than one-third of U.S. adults were not getting enough sleep on a regular basis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). Similar trends are also occurring around the globe (Stranges et al., 2012; Van de Straat & Bracke, 2015). Many studies have shown that inadequate sleep can increase the risk of many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity (McHill & Wright, 2017).
