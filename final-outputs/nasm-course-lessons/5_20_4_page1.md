# Resistance Training Systems

Originally, most resistance training programs were designed by powerlifters, Olympic weightlifters, and bodybuilders. Many of these styles of resistance training programs remain popular today because of good marketing or “gym science,” not because they have been proven to be scientifically superior to other forms of training programs that bring about increases in stabilization, strength, and power. Research has shown that following a systematic, integrated training program and manipulating key training variables can help clients achieve optimal gains in muscular endurance, strength, hypertrophy, and performance (Garber et al., 2011; Grgic et al., 2017; Schoenfeld, Grgic, et al., 2017; Schoenfeld, Ogborn, et al., 2016).

Numerous training systems can be used to structure resistance training programs for a variety of effects. Several of the most common training systems currently used in the fitness industry are presented in this chapter (see **Table 20-5**).

**TABLE 20-5 Resistance Training Systems**

| Type | Definition |
|---|---|
| Warm-up set | 1–2 sets at a low intensity to psychologically and physiologically prepare for the resistance training exercise |
| Single set | Performing one set of each exercise |
| Multiple set | Performing a multiple number of sets for each exercise |
| Pyramid | Increasing (or decreasing) weight with each set |
| Superset | Performing two exercises in rapid succession with minimal rest |
| Complex training | Performing a multijoint or compound exercise, with a heavy load, immediately followed by an explosive movement (e.g., a barbell squat then a vertical jump) |
| Drop set | Performing a set to failure, then removing a small percentage of the load and continuing with the set |
| Giant set | Performing four or more exercises in rotation with as little rest as possible between sets |
| Rest pause | Incorporating a slight pause between repetitions within a series of sets |
| Circuit training | Performing a series of exercises, one after the other, with minimal rest |
| Peripheral heart action | A variation of circuit training that alternates upper and lower body exercises throughout the set |
| Split routine | A resistance training routine that trains different body parts on separate days |
| Vertical loading | A form of training in which strength training exercises are performed in rapid succession, starting with the upper body and working down to the lower body (i.e., total-body → chest → back → shoulders → biceps → triceps → legs) |
| Horizontal loading | Performing all sets of an exercise (or body part) before moving on to the next exercise (or body part) |

## Warm-Up Set

The fitness professional should regularly perform preparatory movements with their clients, prior to undergoing vigorous exercise, which includes resistance training. Warm-up sets require performing one to two sets at a low intensity prior to increasing the load. The purpose of a warm-up set is to psychologically and physiologically prepare the individual for the work to be performed (McGowan et al., 2015). For example, a client may perform one or two sets of a bench press exercise using light weights prior to increasing the load and finishing the remainder of their set; typically, 10 to 15 repetitions are enough for a warm-up set. It is important that the load selected during a warm-up set does not cause undue fatigue and compromise a client’s performance for their remaining sets.
