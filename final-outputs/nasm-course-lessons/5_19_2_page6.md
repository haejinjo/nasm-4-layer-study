### SAQ DRILLS FOR SENIORS

**Varied Size Cone/Hurdle Step-Overs**

	- In a line 10 to 15 yards (9 to 14 meters) long, place various size cones, hurdles, and other objects about 24 inches (61 centimeters) apart.

	- The client lines up, facing sideways to the line of objects; as they step over each object, they move down the line and then back to the start.

	- The client can be timed.

**Stand-Up to Figure 8**

	- The client begins seated in a chair.

	- Two cones are placed directly in front of the chair, with the first placed 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) away; the second is placed 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.6 meters) away, directly behind it.

	- On the instructor’s command, the client stands up from the chair as quickly as possible.

	- As quickly as possible, they move to the left of the first cone, then to the right of the second cone while turning around, to come back to the chair to complete a “figure 8” around the cones.

	- The client then repeats the figure 8 in the opposite direction and finishes by sitting in the chair.

	- The client is timed.
