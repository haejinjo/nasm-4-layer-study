# Introduction to Resistance Training Modalities

Certified Personal Trainers, their clients, and health club members are always searching for new or more effective ways to train and stay motivated. Thus, it is important for fitness professionals to learn how to effectively incorporate the use of various exercise training **modalities** to help clients stay motivated and achieve their personal health and fitness goals. There are a variety of resistance training modalities that can be used to develop strength. The most common form of resistance used in strength training programs is actual load in the form of free weights (e.g., dumbbells, barbells), body weight, selectorized machines, and cable apparatuses. Resistance can also come in the form of elasticity through the use of tubing and bands. This section presents foundational information on popular resistance training modalities, including their benefits and applications. A more detailed discussion of resistance training, including additional resistance training exercises, can be found in Chapter 20, Resistance Training Concepts.

## Risk Versus Reward

Over the past several years, fitness equipment manufacturers have assisted in the development of new fitness equipment and technological devices that allow for increased accountability and tracking. When used correctly, this has enabled fitness professionals to provide more relevant and effective coaching. While new fitness modalities can offer numerous benefits, some precautions must be addressed prior to introducing a new fitness modality into an exercise program.Â Safety and effectiveness must be top of mind when choosing the best training modalities to use and when to integrate them into a program.
