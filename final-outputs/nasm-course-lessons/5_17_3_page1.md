# Guidelines for Balance Training

Balance exercises are a vital component of any integrated training program, because they help ensure optimal muscle recruitment and coordinated movement. Balance training exercises must be systematic and progressive. Fitness professionals should follow specific program guidelines, including proper exercise selection criteria and milestones for progression (**Table 17-4**). Balance is improved through repetitive exposure to a variety of proprioceptively enriched environments (Conradsson & Halvarsson, 2019; Thomas et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).

**TABLE 17-4 Balance Training Parameters**

| Exercise Selection | Variables |
|---|---|
| Safe
	Progressive

		Easy to hard
		Simple to complex
		Stable to unstable
		Static to dynamic
		Slow to fast
		Eyes open to eyes closed
		Known to unknown (cognitive task)
		Single task to dual task

	Balance equipment examples

		Floor
		Balance beam
		Half-foam roll
		Foam pad*
		Balance disc*
		Wobble board* | Plane of motion

		Sagittal
		Frontal
		Transverse

	Lower-body progressions

		Two-legs/stable (e.g., standing on the floor)

			Wide stance → Narrow stance → Tandem stance (heel-to-toe)

		Single-leg/stable (e.g., standing one-legged on the floor)
		Two-legs/unstable (e.g., standing two-legged on a balance modality)
		Single-leg/unstable (e.g., standing one-legged on a balance modality)

	Perturbation

		Mild to moderate (e.g., gentle push in one direction → gentle push in multiple directions) |

^*These modalities come in many shapes and sizes that will dictate proper progression.^

The main goal of balance training is to continually increase the client’s awareness of their limit of stability by increasing the proprioceptive demands of the exercise. An example of challenging the proprioceptive demand could range from having a 65-year-old client balance on the floor in a tandem stance (heel-to-toe posture) to having a 25-year-old athlete balance on one foot while standing on a balance disc.
