## Content
## Plank

### TECHNIQUE

If this version of the exercise is too difficult for a client to perform, some regression options include the following:

	- Perform in a standard push-up position

	- Perform in a push-up position with the knees on the floor

	- Perform with the hands on a bench and the feet on the floor

## Side Plank

### TECHNIQUE

Keep all kinetic chain checkpoints in alignment; do not allow the pelvis to drop toward the floor. This is an excellent exercise to target the transverse abdominis muscle.

## Dead Bug

### TECHNIQUE

This is another excellent exercise to target the local core muscles, but it may take some practice to coordinate all movements. As with other core exercises, maintain a neutral spine and core activation throughout the duration of the exercise.
