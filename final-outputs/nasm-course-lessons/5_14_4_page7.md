**TABLE 14-3 Precautions to Self-Myofascial Techniques**

| Medical Precautions |
|---|
| Hypertension (controlled) | Osteopenia | Pregnancy |
| Diabetes | Varicose veins | Rolling over bony prominences or regions |
| Abnormal sensations (e.g., numbness) | Sensitivity to pressure | Recent injury or surgery |
| Inability to position the body or perform the exercise correctly | Young children | Elderly |
| Scoliosis or spinal deformity | Medications that may alter client sensations | Fibromyalgia |
| Note: This list provides examples, but it is not an exhaustive list. If the client has stated a condition that is not on the list, it is important to have them consult with their physician before engaging in self-myofascial techniques. |

**Contraindications** are medical conditions that would make any type of flexibility exercise unsafe for the client to participate in. Self-myofascial techniques should not be conducted in the presence of a contraindication to ensure client safety. It is important to note that some conditions, such as pregnancy, diabetes, varicose veins, recent injury or surgery, and hypertension, may be considered either precautionary or contraindicative depending on the clientâ€™s status (Cheatham et al., 2018). The contraindications listed in this chapter are not all inclusive as others may be present with specific clients (Cheatham et al., 2018). Therefore, a medical professional should be consulted before proceeding with self-myofascial techniques in the presence of a medical contraindication (**Table 14-4**).
