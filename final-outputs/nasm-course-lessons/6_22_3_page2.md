The high metabolic cost of throwing, catching, decelerating, and accelerating kettlebells can develop unprecedented stamina. By working many fitness components at the same time, workout demands are intensely increased, equating to further caloric expenditure. This cardiovascular demand can be felt during the foundational swing exercise (Vancini et al., 2019).

### KETTLEBELL PROGRAM DESIGN STRATEGIES

As with any training method, proper form and technique must be mastered to avoid injury. The skill required for kettlebell training requires meticulous focused practice, starting with instruction from a qualified kettlebell instructor. Most kettlebell exercises incorporate multiple joint motions and muscle groups, from stabilizers to prime movers, that build both muscular endurance and mental fortitude. Without inward focus and conscious attention to technique, injury may occur, thus, honing all skills with exquisite technique per exercise is mandatory. The emphasis on the posterior chain, working from the ground up and keeping perfect form throughout each repetition, must take priority. Practicing appropriate skills of gluteal and latissimus dorsi contraction along with abdominal hollowing and bracing must be continued and progressed carefully. Because one must be qualified to perform many kettlebell movements, this modality might not be appropriate for all populations.

Moreover—as with all exercises—quality should always come before quantity or weight progression,

and the five kinetic chain checkpoints should be monitored (**Figure 22-1: 4**):

	- *Feet*: approximately shoulders-width apart and pointing straight ahead (when appropriate, depending on the exercise)

	- *Knees*: in line with the second and third toes (avoid valgus or varus motions)

	- *Hips*: level with lumbar spine in a neutral position

	- *Shoulders*: neutral position or depressed and slightly retracted to activate scapulae stabilizers (depending on the exercise)

	- *Head*: cervical spine in a neutral position (chin tuck)
