#### LONG BONES

Long bones are characterized by their long cylindrical body, with irregular or widened bony ends. They are shaped much like a beam and exhibit a slight curvature that is necessary for efficient force distribution (Floyd, 2018). Long bones are composed predominantly of compact bone tissue to ensure strength and stiffness. However, they do have considerable amounts of spongy bone tissue for shock absorption. The long bones of the upper body include the clavicle (collar-bone), humerus (upper arm bone), radius and ulna (forearm bones), metacarpals, and phalanges (finger bones), whereas lower-body long bones include the femur (thigh bone) (**Figure 5-10**), tibia and fibula (shin bones), metatarsals, and phalanges (toe bones) (Hamill et al., 2015).

##### GETTING TECHNICAL

A detailed analysis of long bone anatomy is useful in helping highlight some of the properties and functions of the skeletal system. Here, we see a cross-section of the femur for a visual example of the following internal structures of long bones:

	- Articular (hyaline) cartilage: cartilage that covers the articular surfaces of bones

	- Epiphysis (epiphyses): the end of long bones that contains red marrow that produces red blood cells and is also one of the primary sites for bone growth

	- Diaphysis: the shaft portion of a long bone

	- Epiphyseal plate: the region of long bone connecting the diaphysis to the epiphysis

	- Medullary cavity: the central cavity of bone shafts where marrow is stored

	- Periosteum: a dense fibrous membrane that covers the bone, provides an attachment site for tendons, and contains nerves, blood vessels, and bone-producing cells (Hamill et al., 2015)
