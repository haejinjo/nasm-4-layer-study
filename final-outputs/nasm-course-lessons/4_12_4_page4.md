**Vertical Jump Assessment Position**

	- The fitness professional should measure the standing reach of the client with one arm next to the Vertec.

	- The client should then stand in a ready position underneath the Vertec.

**Vertical Jump Assessment Movement**

	- The client should jump and touch the highest possible vane. No stepping, of any kind, is allowed prior to the jump.

	- The height difference between the standing reach and jumping height is calculated. Red vanes are spaced 6 inches apart, blue vanes 1 inch apart, and white vanes are spaced every 0.5 inches.

	- The client should take a 2-minute rest.

	- A second attempt should be provided. If the client increases their jump height on the second attempt, a third attempt is awarded.

	- The client should be reassessed at regularly scheduled intervals to measure progress.

## Long Jump Assessment

The** long jump assessment**, also known as the broad jump, is designed to test maximal jump distance and lower-extremity horizontal power. This test is considered an advanced assessment for power and performance-specific goals and, as such, may not be suitable for all clients. Generally speaking, Certified Personal Trainers should not perform this assessment for clients with general fitness or weight-loss goals. This test is most appropriate for clients with athletic goals and seeking to assess lower-body power. A proper warm-up is encouraged before beginning any maximal performance testing.

**Long Jump Assessment Position**

	- A tape measure should be extended along a nonslip surface, with a starting line marked with athletic tape.

	- The client should stand in a ready position behind the line.

**Long Jump Assessment Movement**

	- The client should jump forward as far as possible. It should be a 2-feet jump with a 2-feet landing. No stepping, of any kind, is allowed prior to or after the jump.

	- The jump distance should be measured from the starting line to the heels of the feet after landing.

	- The client should take a 2-minute rest.

	- A second attempt should be provided. If the client increases their jump distance on the second attempt, a third attempt is awarded.

	- The client should be reassessed at regularly scheduled intervals to measure progress.
