## Content
### Seated Cable Row

---

#### TECHNIQUE

To increase the effectiveness of the exercise and decrease the risk of injury, keep the torso stationary throughout the execution of the exercise. Flexing and extending the torso while performing the row creates momentum, which decreases the effectiveness of the exercise and may place stress on the low-back.

### Seated Lat Pulldown

---

#### SAFETY

Performing lat pulldowns with a bar behind the neck is not advised, because this places stress on the shoulder joints and cervical spine. If performing the lat pulldown exercise with a bar, the bar should pass in front of the face, to approximately shoulder height.
