## Content
### SMR: Thoracic Spine

#### TECHNIQUE

The client keeps the bridge position and rolls along the thoracic spine. The client can choose to support their head in their hands (as shown) or cross their arms in front of their chest. This is a good technique to gain thoracic extension of the spine. Avoid rolling over the low-back (lumbar spine) and neck (cervical spine).

### SMR: Latissimus Dorsi

#### TECHNIQUE

To target the latissimus dorsi, lie on the floor on one side with the arm closest to the floor outstretched and thumb facing upward. Place the foam roller under the armpit area (axillary region) and slowly roll until a tender spot is identified.

## Precautions and Contraindications

Before programming self-myofascial techniques, fitness professionals should consider any **medical precautions** or contraindications. Medical precautions are any medical conditions that could be unsafe for flexibility exercise. In the presence of a medical precaution, the fitness professional may be able to modify an exercise for the client to be safe. For example, foam rolling for a client with osteopenia (a precursor to osteoporosis) is considered a precaution due to the risk of causing bone injury. As a modification, the fitness professional may choose to teach low-intensity, static stretching of the legs and arms to the client. The precautions listed in **Table 14-3 **are not all inclusive, as other precautions may be present with specific clients. Before recommending flexibility exercises, the fitness professional must use good judgment and communicate with the client and supervising medical professional to obtain proper clearance.
