## Content
One of the reasons sleep deprivation is associated with an increased risk of obesity is because chronic sleep deprivation adversely affects appetite and satiety hormones in the body. Several studies have shown that after several nights of inadequate sleep, levels of the satiety hormone **peptide YY** are lower and levels of the hunger hormone **ghrelin** are higher in participants (Hibi et al., 2017; Reutrakul & Van Cauter, 2018). Some studies also show that impaired sleep can contribute to greater caloric intake on the subsequent day (Al Khatib et al., 2017). Thus, poor sleep can have a detrimental effect on weight management. Encouraging clients to get the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep remains an important factor in helping them achieve their weight and body composition goals.

### ENDOCRINE DISORDERS

Weight gain and difficulty losing weight is also influenced by several endocrine (hormonal) disorders and disruptions, which can affect any client’s weight or render it difficult for an individual to achieve weight changes. Several endocrine disorders that typically result in weight gain include **hypothyroidism**, **Cushing’s syndrome**, **polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)**, and insulinoma (a pancreatic tumor that causes the production of excess insulin) (Kokkoris & Pi-Sunyer, 2003). Treatment of the underlying medical issue usually addresses the weight gain while allowing an individual to successfully manage their weight. If a client presents with a medical issue that may be contributing to weight gain or loss, they should be referred to a medical professional and/or an RD for medical and nutritional guidance.

### MEDICATIONS

Several medications, such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, psychotropics, contraceptive pills, and steroids such as prednisone, can also affect an individual’s propensity to lose or gain weight. Weight gain and metabolic dysregulation are particularly associated with the use of psychotropic medications (De Hert et al., 2011; Hasnain & Vieweg, 2015) and some antidepressants (Himmerich et al., 2015). These medications appear to disrupt glucose and lipid metabolism and may also affect the amount of physical activity, all of which may be contributory to the weight gain.

Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, also contribute to weight gain through an increase in appetite as well as fluid retention (University of California, San Francisco, n.d.). Clients who are taking an oral contraceptive may also be susceptible to weight changes due to hormonal fluctuations. Clients who are taking any psychotropic, corticosteroid, or hormone medications and experiencing either weight gain or loss should be referred to a medical professional and/or an RD for weight management and medication review. They should also be referred to a medical professional and/or an RD for a review of their medications and diet, because an assessment of these are outside the scope of practice for a fitness professional.

### METABOLISM

Metabolism can be defined as the chemical changes in living cells by which energy is provided for vital processes and activities, and new material is assimilated (“Metabolism,” n.d.). In broader terms, it can be thought of as the cumulation of all the energy usage of an organism, such as the human body. Metabolism is often referred to as an individual’s BMR, which is the number of calories that they would burn at rest, outside of physical activity or food intake. BMR is essentially the body’s energy requirement to fuel biological processes outside of physical activity, such as respiration, digestion, cellular signaling, and mitochondrial activity. Also, it is one component of an individual’s TDEE and is usually the largest, except in cases of strenuous and prolonged physical activity or exercise, such as ultra-endurance events.

## Key Terms

**Peptide YY**
Called peptide tyrosine and is a peptide that is released in the colon during feeding.

**Ghrelin**
The hunger hormone that stimulates appetite.

**Hypothyroidism**
Low activity of the thyroid gland that can disrupt heart rate, body temperature, and metabolism.

**Cushing's syndrome**
A hormone disorder that causes abnormally high levels of cortisol in the body.

**Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)**
A hormone disorder that occurs in women of childbearing age that causes irregular periods, excess levels of the male hormone androgen, small cysts on the outer edges of the ovaries, and obesity.
