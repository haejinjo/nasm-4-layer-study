### OPEN-CHAIN MOVEMENTS

The primary characteristic of open-chain movements is that the distal segments (hands and feet) are not fixed, and they are free to move in space. Additionally, open-chain exercises have independent joint movement of only the segments distal to the moving joint itself (Kisner & Colby, 2007). While not required, a majority of open-chain activities are nonweight-bearing.

Examples of open-chain exercises include lat pulldown, biceps curl, bench press, leg curl, and leg extension exercises (**Figure 7-14**). Unlike closed-chain exercises, which activate multiple muscles, open-chain exercises tend to focus on isolating the prime mover muscles (Kisner & Colby, 2007).
