## Content
### Barbell Squat

---

#### SAFETY

“How far down should your client squat?” The answer is, “Only as far as can be controlled without compensating.” As your client develops more flexibility and stabilization strength, the range of motion can be increased, assuming no compensations occur.

### Deadlift

---

#### TECHNIQUE

Monitor all five kinetic chain checkpoints throughout the duration of the exercise, especially your client’s spine position. The spine should remain neutral rather than rounded and hunched over.
