# Guidelines for Core Training

A comprehensive core training program should be systematic, progressive, and functional and emphasize the entire muscle action spectrum focusing on force production (concentric), force reduction (eccentric), and dynamic stabilization (isometric). A core training program should regularly manipulate planes of motion, ranges of motion, body position, speed of execution, and specific acute training variables (e.g., sets, reps, intensity, tempo, frequency) (**Table 16-2**).

When designing a core training program, the fitness professional should initially create a proprioceptively enriched training environment. Proprioception training offers a controlled yet unstable training environment with a selection of appropriate exercises to elicit a maximal training response and involves activities that emphasize awareness of body position in space. Core exercises performed in an unstable environment (such as with a stability ball) have been demonstrated to increase activation of the local and global stabilization system (Behm et al., 2005; Carter et al., 2006; Escamilla et al., 2016). As also outlined in Table 16-2, the core exercises must be safe and challenging and stress multiple planes in a multisensory environment derived from fundamental movement skills specific to the activity.

## TRAINING TIP

The use of weight belts for apparently healthy adults engaging in a moderately intense exercise program is not recommended. Weight belts may raise an individual’s heart rate and systolic blood pressure and often give individuals a false sense of security and the misconception that they can lift heavier loads. Instead, fitness professionals need to educate their clients as to appropriate exercise technique and proper activation of the body’s natural belt: the core musculature.
