## Content
SAQ training is a system of progressive exercises and instruction aimed at developing fundamental motor abilities to enhance the capability of individuals to be more skillful at faster speeds and with greater precision (Chandrakumar & Ramesh, 2015). The movement patterns used can also be of great assistance in preventing falls and increasing agility, reaction time, sprinting velocity, and lower-body power.

SAQ training is similar to explosive jump, or plyometric training, but the idea is to propel the body as quickly as possible, to accelerate and decelerate as fast as possible, or to change directions with ease and speed changes. Like plyometrics, SAQ exercises can be completed as their own workout or combined into an integrated training session. Refer to **Table 13-7** for benefits regarding SAQ training.

**TABLE 13-7 Benefits of SAQ Training**

| Improved performance for top speed, change of direction, and rate of acceleration/deceleration
	Improved health-related physical fitness
	Enhanced response time to a stimulus or better reaction time
	Improved technical skills in sprinting and change of direction mechanics |

## Resistance Training

Resistance training can promote marked increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy, with improvements in these outcome measures seen irrespective of age and gender (Schoenfeld et al., 2016b). In addition, resistance training has shown to be an effective mode of exercise to improve bone density and muscular strength and enhance cardiovascular health (Garber et al., 2011; Hart & Buck, 2019; Westcott, 2012). Moreover, resistance training plays a fundamental role in improving athletic performance and rehabilitation from musculoskeletal injury (Kristensen & Franklyn-Miller, 2012; Vesci et al., 2017). Lastly, resistance exercise is an effective method for increasing lean body mass and reducing body fat, especially when it is combined with proper dietary measures.

The role of resistance training in an integrated training program cannot be overemphasized, and fitness professionals must be well-versed in its benefits. In addition, fitness professionals must be skilled at designing and implementing resistance training protocols for a variety of clients, including youths, athletes, elderly, pre- and postnatal parents, and weight-loss clients. Refer to **Table 13-8** for benefits regarding resistance training.

**TABLE 13-8 Benefits of Resistance Training**

| Increased endurance, strength, and power
	Increased muscular hypertrophy
	Improved weight management and enhanced weight-loss efforts
	Improved resting metabolic rate, resting heart rate, and blood pressure
	Improved coordination and athleticism
	Decreased risk of injury due to strength of all soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and muscle fibers) |
