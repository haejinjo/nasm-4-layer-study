### PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF WORKING WITH OBESE CLIENTS

Obesity is a unique chronic disease because it may also affect a person’s sense of emotional well-being and self-esteem (Beck, 2016). Obesity can alter the emotional and social aspects of a person’s life as much as it does the physical aspects. Fitness professionals must be very aware of the psychosocial aspects of obesity when training obese clients to ensure that the client feels socially and emotionally safe. Such attention to their emotional and physical well-being will help create trust between the client and fitness professional and assist the client in adhering to a weight-loss and exercise program.

Proper exercise selections and positions are very important to the client’s sense of well-being. For example, machines are often not designed for obese individuals and may require a significant amount of mobility to get in and out of. Dumbbells, cables, or exercise tubing exercises work quite well instead of machines. The use of self-myofascial techniques performed on the floor should be done with caution, or avoided altogether, as some obese clients may not feel comfortable performing these flexibility techniques. It may be a good idea to recommend that certain exercises be performed in the privacy of their own home or in a location within a health club that offers privacy if the client communicates issues of confidence. In addition, it is recommended that obese clients engage in weight-supported exercise (such as cycling or swimming) to decrease orthopedic (joint) stress. However, walking is often both a preferred activity for many obese clients and one that is easily engaged in and adhered to. Thus, if the benefits of walking, particularly **adherence**, exceed the observed or perceived risk of an orthopedic injury, walking may be a primary exercise recommendation. When working with this population, fitness professionals must make sure of all the situations in which the obese client will exercise, including positions, locations in the training facility that offer greater privacy, and choice of exercise equipment. Exercise considerations for obese clients are given in **Tables 23-6 **and **23-7**.

**TABLE 23-6: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals Who Are Overweight or Obese**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness |
|---|---|
| May have other comorbidities (diagnosed or undiagnosed), including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. | Initial screening should clarify the presence of potential undiagnosed comorbidities. |
| Maximal oxygen uptake and ventilatory (anaerobic) threshold is typically reduced. | Consider testing and training modalities that are weight supported (such as cycle ergometer, swimming, water aerobics).

If a client does not have these limitations, consider a walking program to improve compliance. |
| Coexisting diets may hamper exercise ability and result in significant loss of lean body mass.. | Initial programming should emphasize low intensity, with a progression in exercise duration (up to 60 minutes as tolerable) and frequency (5–7 days per week), before increases are made in intensity of exercise.

Exercise intensity should be no greater than 60–80% of work capacity, with weekly caloric volume a minimum of 1,200 kcal per week and a progression to 2,000, as tolerable. |
| Measures of body composition may not accurately reflect degree of overweight or obesity | BMI, scale weight, hip-to-waist or circumference measurements are recommended measures of weight loss. |

## Key Terms

**Adherence**
The level of commitment to a behavior or plan of action.
