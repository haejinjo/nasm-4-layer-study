#### MEDICATIONS

Many clients seeking fitness and exercise training advice from fitness professionals will currently be under the care of a physician or another medical professional, and they may be taking one or more prescribed medications. It is not the role of the Certified Personal Trainer to administer, prescribe, or educate clients on the usage and effects of any form of legally prescribed medication by a licensed physician or other healthcare provider. Certified Personal Trainers should always consult with their client’s physician or medical professionals regarding the client’s health information and which medications they may be currently taking, if any.
