## Content
**Horizontal loading** refers to performing all sets of an exercise or body part before moving on to the next exercise or body part, as shown in **Table 20-9**. For example, if performing three sets of a chest exercise and three sets of a back exercise, the client would perform all three sets of the chest exercise before moving to the back exercise. The progression of exercises is therefore said to be horizontal across the template. This is the method most commonly used in health club environments and is appropriate for hypertrophy, maximal strength, and power training (Grgic et al., 2017; Schoenfeld, 2011; Schoenfeld, Pope, et al., 2016).

**TABLE 20-9 Horizontal Loading**

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Tempo | Rest | Coaching Tip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total body | → | → | → | → | Complete all sets before moving to the next exercise |
| Legs |  |  |  |  |  |
| Chest |  |  |  |  |  |
| Back |  |  |  |  |  |
| Shoulders |  |  |  |  |  |
| Biceps |  |  |  |  |  |
| Triceps |  |  |  |  |  |

The drawback to the horizontal loading system is the amount of time typically spent resting, which can often be more time than the actual workout itself. Horizontal loading can be a metabolic progression if rest periods are monitored and limited to 30 to 90 seconds between sets. If the same muscle groups are forced to work with minimal recovery, it can lead to faster development of metabolic and hypertrophy-related adaptations in the muscle (Grgic et al., 2017; Schoenfeld, 2011; Schoenfeld, Pope, et al., 2016; Wilk, Stastny, et al., 2018).
