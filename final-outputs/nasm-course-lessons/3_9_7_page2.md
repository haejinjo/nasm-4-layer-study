## Content
Products containing between one and three servings are required to list the nutrition information for one serving and the entire container, therefore displaying a dual column nutrition facts label (**Figure 9-10**). This may be helpful to consumers, because packages with one to three servings may at times be consumed in a single setting. **Table 9-21** (on the following page) describes key considerations for reviewing the nutrition facts label.

# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Added sugar was not listed on the initial U.S. nutrition facts label. The current label, as established in 2016, specifies both total and added sugars for a product. Some products, such as dairy and fruit, contain naturally occurring sugars; dairy contains lactose, and fruit contains both glucose and fructose. Natural sugars should not be of excess concern for most clients, unless they are diabetic, in which case, they should be referred to a qualified medical professional. Added sugars, however, are those that have been added to a product: table sugar (sucrose), corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, dextrin, maltodextrin, cane syrup, and so forth. Per the U.S. Dietary Guidelines 2015â€“2020, adults are recommended to limit the amount of added sugar in their diet to less than 10% of total calories (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).
