# The Respiratory System

The function of the **respiratory system**, also known as the pulmonary system, is to bring oxygen into the lungs from the air as it is breathed in and to expel carbon dioxide from the lungs to the outside environment. The respiratory system includes airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles (**Figure 6-8**) The primary role of the respiratory system is to ensure proper cellular function (Brown, 2000; McArdle et al., 2016). The respiratory system works intimately with the cardiovascular system to accomplish optimal cellular function by transporting oxygen from the external environment into the body while removing carbon dioxide from the blood and expelling it out of the body (McArdle et al., 2016).

This entire process is accomplished through the integrated functioning of the respiratory pump to move air in and out of the body and of the respiratory passageways to channel the air into the lungs (McArdle et al., 2016). An additional function of the respiratory system is to filter the 7,000 to 9,000 liters of air we breathe every day to help eliminate foreign particles and infectious germs (Reid et al., 2014; Swain, 2014).

## Key Terms
