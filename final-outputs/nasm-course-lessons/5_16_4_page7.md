## Content
## Reverse Crunch

### TECHNIQUE

Do not swing the legs when performing this exercise. Once you have positioned the lower extremities during the setup, they should not move during the execution of the exercise. Swinging the legs increases momentum, increasing the risk of injury and decreasing the effectiveness of the exercise.

## Knee-Up

### TECHNIQUE

The knee-up is performed in a similar fashion to the reverse crunch except the knees are fully extended. During the concentric phase, extend the feet toward the ceiling by lifting the hips off the bench then slowly lowering the hips back to the starting position.
