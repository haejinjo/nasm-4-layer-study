## OPT Daily Workout Template

The OPT model uses a specific workout template to help organize daily exercise routines in a safe, systematic, and progressive fashion. No matter which of the five phases of training are being used, the same template is always followed; the only differences are the acute variables and exercises selected (**Figure 21: -7**). The workout template is structured to take the client from a warm-up through cool-down and is divided into six parts: Warm-Up, Activation, Skill Development, Resistance Training, Client’s Choice, and Cool-Down.
