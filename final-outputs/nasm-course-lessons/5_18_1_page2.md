# Principles of Plyometric Training

**Plyometric training**, also known as jump or reactive training, is a form of exercise that uses explosive movements, such as bounding, jumping, or forceful upper body movements, to develop muscular power. Employing plyometric training develops efficient control and production of **ground reaction forces**, which can be used to project the body with greater velocity or speed of movement. The term *reactive training* refers to the reaction stimulus clients encounter during plyometric training, which is the ground surface in this case. Therefore, reactive and plyometric training are used interchangeably throughout this chapter.

It is important for the fitness professional to understand that individual clients must possess adequate core strength, joint stability, and range of motion and have the ability to balance efficiently prior to performing explosive plyometric exercises. Plyometric training may not be an appropriate form of training for individuals with select chronic diseases or other functional limitations. However, the practice of plyometric training is very important considering the numerous injuries that occur as a result of an individual’s inability to control decelerative force and that it is often used in latter stages of physical rehabilitation (Hill & Leiszler, 2011). The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the importance of plyometric training and the physiology and methodology involved in designing and implementing plyometric training into a client’s existing exercise program.

## Key Terms

**Plyometric training**
Exercises that generate quick, powerful movements involving an explosive concentric muscle contraction preceded by an eccentric muscle action.

**Ground reaction force**
Reaction force imparted by the ground on the body when a body segment makes contact with it.
