## Content
Certified Personal Trainers could be considered among the most important employees in a health club because they come in direct contact with club members on a daily basis and help them achieve the results they desire. The primary business of a health club is to sell and retain memberships. With that in mind, an employer has a vested interest in seeing Certified Personal Trainers succeed, because the more members who purchase personal training services, the more revenue is generated for the company.

As a direct employee, a fitness professional is often paid an hourly rate when working a scheduled shift on the fitness floor, an additional amount when delivering a personal training session to a client, and various bonuses based on the amount of personal training sold or the number of personal training sessions delivered. In most employment models, a fitness professional can earn anywhere from 40% to 70% of what the client pays the club for the individual training session.

### INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONALS

Another option for working as a Certified Personal Trainer is the independent contractor model in which a fitness professional contracts their services to one or more health clubs or training studios. As independent contractors, fitness professionals will pay either a per-client or monthly fee to a facility to be able to use that location, essentially becoming customers of the facility themselves. Additionally, independent fitness professionals can train clients at their homes or in public spaces like parks and athletic fields (**Table 2-2**).

**TABLE 2-2 Employment Options for Independent Contractors**

| Studio or health club | Fitness professionals pay rent to use a facility as long as they have their own liability insurance and adhere to established guidelines and operating procedures. |
