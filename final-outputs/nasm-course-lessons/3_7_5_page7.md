## Content
#### DEEP LONGITUDINAL SUBSYSTEM

The deep longitudinal subsystem (DLS) includes muscles of the lower leg, hamstrings, and lower back region (**Figure 7-19**). Working together synergistically, these muscles create a contracting tension to absorb and control ground reaction forces during gait (walking, running). For example, during or just prior to the heel strike phase of running, the long head of the biceps femoris (hamstring) contracts eccentrically to decelerate knee extension. Because the hamstrings attach at the pelvis, forces are transmitted up to the lower back muscles (erector spinae). Thus, the regional interdependence between the lower extremity ankle musculature, the hamstrings, and lower back is highlighted.

#### POSTERIOR OBLIQUE SUBSYSTEM

The posterior oblique subsystem (POS) is made up of the latissimus dorsi, thoracolumbar fascia (connective tissue of the low-back), and contralateral gluteus maximus. **Figure 7-20** showsÂ how the latissimus dorsi and contralateral gluteus maximus create a nearly straight line with each other across the sacroiliac joint (a joint between the sacrum and the ilium bones).
