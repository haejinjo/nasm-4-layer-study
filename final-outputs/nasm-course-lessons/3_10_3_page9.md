### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

The proper use of dietary supplements, particularly multivitamin and mineral formulas, has been shown to help fill common and widespread nutrient gaps (Bailey et al., 2012; Blumberg et al., 2017). Blumberg et al. (2017) analyzed the intake of 17 nutrients in nearly 11,000 adults in the United States from either food alone or food and a multivitamin and mineral supplement. Higher frequency of use eliminated inadequate intakes of all the vitamins and minerals examined, with the exception of vitamins D and E, calcium, and magnesium. Moreover, 16 out of 17 nutrient intakes were significantly improved when using the multivitamin supplement. Hence, the use of a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement to avoid common insufficiencies and meet recommended intakes based on age, gender, and life stage appears to be an effective nutritional strategy. Achieving daily requirements for minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and other essential nutrients, such as vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, may require separate supplementation. Although dietary supplements do not replace a healthful diet, they can help achieve recommended intakes of essential nutrients, which may play a supportive and critical role in healthy aging.

## Omega-3 Supplements

**Omega-3** fats are one of the more thoroughly researched dietary supplements available. Often supplemented as fish oil, omega-3 supplements may be important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, reduction of inflammatory status, and neurological development. They are the third most frequently used dietary supplement, and fitness professionals can anticipate discussing them with clients (Grand View Research, 2019).

Omega-3 supplements are a type of unsaturated fatty acid with a unique physical structure. There are three types of omega-3: **eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)**, **docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)**, and **alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)** (**Table 10-5**). EPA and DHA are known as the fish oils, and ALA is a plant source of omega-3 that converts to EPA and then to DHA. The fish oils have the greatest biological relevance, as they are biologically active forms, and only about 5–15% of ALA converts to EPA (Gerster, 1998; Wang et al., 2006).

**TABLE 10-5 Omega-3 Fatty Acids**

| Omega-3 Fatty Acids | Sources |
|---|---|
| Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) | Fatty fish: herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines, cod liver |
| Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) | Fatty fish: herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines, cod liver |
| Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) | Plants: chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed, and their oils |

Ingesting at least 250 mg of fish oil is required to begin having positive health outcomes, such as the reduction of coronary heart disease, but fish oil may be more optimally dosed between 1 and 4 g per day (de Lorgeril et al., 1994; Harris, 1997; Mozaffarian, 2008). The ideal dose may be greater depending on the omega-6 content of the individual’s diet, as the benefits of fish oil may be due to the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. Omega-3s are characterized as being anti-inflammatory and omega-6s proinflammatory. Therefore, if one’s diet contains a lot of omega-6 fatty acids, more omega-3 may be necessary to balance inflammation (Simopoulos, 2008). In addition to the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, the EPA to DHA ratio is also of relevance, and while the precise ideal ratio is unknown, a 2:1 ratio of EPA to DHA is supported (Shang et al., 2017).

## Key Terms

**Omega-3**
The polyunsaturated fats, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).

**Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)**
A type of omega-3 fatty acid found in the flesh of cold-water fish, such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, and herring.

**Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)**
A type of omega-3 fatty acid that is found in seafood, such as fish and fish oils.

**Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)**
One type of omega-3 fatty acid found in seeds and oils, such as walnuts and flaxseed, and many common vegetable oils.
