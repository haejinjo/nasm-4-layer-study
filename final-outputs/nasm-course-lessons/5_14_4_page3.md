## Content
It is crucial to note that when a person is using a foam roller, they should find a tender spot and sustain pressure on that spot for a minimum of 30 seconds (**Table 14-2**), which will increase the relaxation response. It may take longer, depending on the client’s ability to consciously relax. Self-myofascial rolling is suggested before stretching because it may potentially improve the effectiveness of static stretching techniques (Škarabot et al., 2015). In addition, self-myofascial rolling can be used during the cool-down process.

**TABLE 14-2 Self-Myofascial Rolling Summary**

| Type of Stretch | Mechanism of Action | Training Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Self-myofascial rolling | Autogenic inhibition | 1–3 sets

Hold each tender area for 30 seconds |

## Foam Rolling Exercises

### SMR: Calves

#### TECHNIQUE

Crossing one leg on top of the other is optional and is used to increase pressure to the calf. Roll along the length of the calf muscles.

### SMR: Peroneals

#### TECHNIQUE

Stacking the legs is optional and is used to increase pressure on the peroneals. Roll along the length of the muscle. Avoid rolling over the knee joint.
