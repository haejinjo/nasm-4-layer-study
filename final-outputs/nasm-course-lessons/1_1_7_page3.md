## Content
- *COPD* is an umbrella term for lung diseases characterized by increased breathlessness, airflow limitation, and accelerated decline of lung function.

	- Two of the most common issues at the foot and ankle are sprains and plantar fasciitis. An ankle sprain occurs when a person rolls, twists, or turns an ankle, which stretches or tears ligaments, whereas plantar fasciitis causes pain in the plantar fascia tissue located on the underside of the foot.

	- The LPHC is made up of the lumbar spine (low-back area), pelvis, abdomen, and hip musculoskeletal structures; it is more commonly referred to as the “core.” The LPHC is an important anatomical structure because it connects the upper and lower halves of a person’s body.

	- Shoulder dysfunction is very common in the greater population, especially in those who frequently lift objects overhead.

	- Regular exercise and increased physical activity have been frequently shown by research to improve numerous types of musculoskeletal dysfunction and chronic disease.

	- Understanding the scopes of practice for all adjacent allied health professionals, as well as all relevant local laws and regulations, will ensure Certified Personal Trainers are always working within their own scope of practice.

	- Networking with other allied health professionals and certified fitness professionals can lead to great levels of success in the fitness industry.

	- An NASM Certified Personal Trainer must always adhere to the NASM Code of Professional Conduct.
