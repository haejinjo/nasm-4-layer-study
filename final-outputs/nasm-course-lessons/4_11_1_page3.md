## Content
## Purpose of Assessments

Although the general purposes of conducting physiological assessments are to collect baseline data to help fitness professionals develop personalized exercise programs, they serve many other important roles:

	- Identifying individuals who are at increased risk for any cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic diseases, or their signs or symptoms, and should first undergo more thorough medical evaluations

	- Identifying individuals with medical **contraindications **who should be excluded from exercise until conditions have been corrected or are under control

	- Identifying those individuals with medical contraindications who should participate in medically supervised programs

	- Reducing the need for unwarranted medical evaluations prior to partaking in an exercise program for apparently healthy adults

	- Providing appropriate recommendations regarding initiation or continuation of exercise or physical activity

	- Educating individuals about their current physical condition

	- Enabling effective program evaluation (i.e., tracking progress) using baseline and follow-up data

	- Using the information to motivate individuals through realistic goal setting

# Preparticipation Screening

As indicated previously, it is necessary to always screen an individual with an HRA prior to starting any exercise regimen that involves exertion. This screening should take place prior to participation in any strenuous fitness assessments or exercise.

## The Health Risk Assessment

Questionnaires are used to collect information regarding existing risk factors for participation in exercise and physical activity to determine the need for medical clearance beforehand. This is a vital, first step in the preparticipation screening process, but this screening procedure should always be valid, simple, and cost and time efficient, and it should also be appropriate for the target population. Remember, new exercisers may be apprehensive, both about starting exercise and the use of a long, overly detailed and time-consuming HRA, which might increase their anxieties associated with moving forward.

### PHYSICAL ACTIVITY READINESS  QUESTIONNAIRE (PAR-Q+)

The **Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+)** was developed in 2011, and updated in 2019, as an attempt to simplify the preparticipation screening and remove some of the unnecessary barriers for individuals seeking to adopt active behaviors, such as excessive and unnecessary doctor referrals (*Health and Fitness Journal of Canada*, 2014; Warburton et al., 2014). It is a questionnaire given to prospective clients to gain insight into their current health and wellness.
