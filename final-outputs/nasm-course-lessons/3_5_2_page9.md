# HELPFUL HINT

Use the “breakfast, lunch, and dinner” analogy to help remember structures of the spine:

	- Breakfast at 7:00 a.m. = 7 cervical vertebrae at the neck

	- Lunch at  p.m. = 12 thoracic vertebrae at the mid-back

	- Dinner at 5:00 p.m. = 5 lumbar vertebrae at the low-back

In between the vertebrae are **intervertebral discs** made of fibrous cartilage that act as shock absorbers and allow the spine to move (Newell et al., 2017). In addition to allowing humans to stand upright and maintain their balance, the vertebral column serves several other important functions. It helps support the head and arms while permitting freedom of movement. It also provides attachment sites for many muscles, the ribs, and connective tissue (Galbusera & Bassani, 2019).

When looking at the body from a side view, the spinal column has a curved shape that partially resembles the letter S. The optimal arrangement of curves is referred to as a **neutral spine** and represents a position in which the vertebrae and associated structures are under the least amount of load and can most optimally support functional movement (Wallden, 2009). The adult human spine has three major curvatures (**Figure 5-23**):

	- Posterior (concave) cervical curve (hollowed or rounded inward)

	- Posterior (convex) thoracic curve (curved or rounded outward)

	- Posterior (concave) lumbar curve (hollowed or rounded inward)

## Key Terms

**Intervertebral discs**
Fibrous cartilage structures between vertebrae that act as shock absorbers and assist with movement.

**Neutral Spine**
Represents a position in which the vertebrae and associated structures are under the least amount of load and can most optimally support functional movement.
