# Implementing Fitness  Assessments

After implementing a thorough health screening, administering postural, movement, and performance assessments provide an opportunity for fitness professionals to establish a baseline for their client’s functional status. Since Certified Personal Trainers will work with a wide range of clients, it is helpful to evaluate static and dynamic posture prior to designing and implementing a fitness program to help provide insight to the physical capabilities and limitations of the client. These assessments will provide a baseline level of function as well as postural and movement impairments that need to be corrected throughout the programming. This information will also help inform the selection of exercises and intensity at which an individual can perform. Lastly, performing these assessments before implementing an exercise program will provide a baseline from which to evaluate progress in static posture, movement quality, and dynamic performance. The following list describes the benefits of conducting and implementing fitness assessments:

	- Assessing a client’s static posture allows for a quick understanding of how they position their body during the day.

	- Movement and performance assessments demonstrate a baseline of the client’s functional status in a wide range of tasks.

	- Movement assessments are helpful to identify and correct movement impairments and potential muscle imbalances.

	- Strength-based assessments allow the fitness professional to accurately assess a client’s maximal strength capabilities.

	- Performance assessments allow for careful tracking of athletic performance (e.g., power, speed, agility, muscular endurance).

## Sequencing Assessments

Certified Personal Trainers can use static postural and overhead squat assessments as recruiting tools for prospective clients. By offering these assessments, often complimentary, clients are more likely to engage with the fitness professional and begin to build trust in their expertise. The fitness professional can encourage the client by telling them good things about their posture and movement, while also pointing out any impairments that they can help correct with a focused exercise program.

For example, if a client agreed to participate in a complimentary OHSA, the fitness professional may be able to identify a common pattern of excessive knee valgus during the squat. The fitness professional could then tell the client how they were impressed with their squat depth but how important it is to maintain good alignment during the squat for long-term knee health. This would then be a natural time to show some simple modifications to their technique and explain how a focused exercise plan, with proper supervision, could help the client to squat more safely and effectively.

### ONBOARDING AND SEQUENCING ASSESSMENTS

All movement assessments should begin with a standing, static postural assessment. Any postural distortions can affect the length-tension of muscles and increase stress on the body throughout a person’s day. As a result, it is important for the fitness professional to have confidence in evaluating static standing posture, which will also serve as the foundation for movement and performance assessments.
