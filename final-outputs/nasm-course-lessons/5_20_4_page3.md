## The Pyramid System

The pyramid system involves a progressive or regressive step approach that either increases weight with each set or decreases weight with each set (**Figure 20-5**). In the light to heavy system, the individual typically performs 10 to 12 repetitions with a light load and increases theÂ load for each following set, until the individual can perform 1 or 2 repetitions, usually in four to six sets. This system can also be used for workouts that involve only two to four sets or higher repetition schemes of 12 to 20 repetitions. The heavy to light system works in the opposite direction, in which the individual warms up and then begins with a heavy load for 1 to 2 repetitions, then decreases the load and increases the repetitions for four to six sets.

## The Superset System

The superset system uses two exercises performed in rapid succession, one after another. There are multiple variations of the superset system.

The first variation includes performing two exercises for the same muscle group back to back. For example, an individual may perform the bench press exercise, immediately followed by push-ups, to fatigue the chest musculature. Completing two exercises in this manner will improve muscular endurance and hypertrophy because the volume of work performed is relatively high. This style of superset can use two, three (termed a *triset*), or more (termed a *giant set*) exercises for the target muscle group. The greater the number of exercises used, the greater the degree of fatigue experienced and demands on muscular endurance.

The second variation consists of performing two exercises back to back that involve opposing muscle groups, such as the chest and back or quadriceps and hamstring complex. Performing supersets in this manner allows a significant load to be placed on the target muscle during each set. This is possible because while the agonist (prime mover) is working, the antagonist is recovering, and vice versa.

Supersetting typically involves sets of 8 to 12 repetitions with no rest between sets or exercises; however, any number of repetitions can be used. The superset system is popular among bodybuilders and athletes and may be beneficial for muscular endurance, muscular hypertrophy, or power, depending on the exercises used.

## Complex Training

Complex training is an effective, time-efficient training method for enhancing strength and power, which alternates heavy resistance exercise with an explosive power exercise that is biomechanically similar in movement (Freitas et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2017). This provides the fitness professional an opportunity to train both sides of the force-velocity equation in one session. Specifically, the fitness professional can train their client on both the force end with heavy loads (e.g., squats) coupled with a higher-velocity movement (e.g., squat jumps). The premise behind complex training is that the client or athlete can perform the power or plyometric exercise more explosively due to the previous heavy-load exercise (Tredrea, 2017).
