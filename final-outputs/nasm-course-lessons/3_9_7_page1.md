# Food Labels

Food labels on products convey important information on ingredients and nutritional content; labels can help clients make informed decisions about the ways in which food items contribute to their nutrition and fitness goals. The ability to read and interpret a food label can help clients compare products and select healthier options. Food labels may differ slightly from country to country, but in general, each includes the following information: product name, quantity provided in the package, manufacturer’s name and address, ingredient list, and a nutrition facts label (often referred to as a nutrition information panel). The nutrition facts label displays all the nutrition information within a given product. This information can be used to compare products in addition to evaluating a product’s nutritional contribution to an individual’s diet.

## U.S. Food Labels

In the United States, the nutrition facts label on packaged foods is typically displayed on the back of the package, along with the **ingredients list** and a statement on any allergens included in the product: egg, dairy, wheat, soy, peanuts, etc. For consumers, the two most informative features of a food label are likely the nutrition facts label and the ingredient list.

### NUTRITION FACTS PANEL

In the United States, the **nutrition facts panel** on packaged foods provides nutritional information for a specified serving of the product (**Figure 9-9**).

Two pieces of information that should be reviewed are the servings per container and the **serving size**. Servings per container indicates the number of servings of the product provided in the package, based on the specified serving size. The serving size is a reference amount based on the quantity of the product consumers are thought to typically consume at one sitting; it should be viewed as a reference amount for information, rather than a recommended amount for consumption. Individuals may consume a portion size that is more or less than the specific serving size of the product, based on their calorie and macronutrient needs, hunger levels, and preference.
