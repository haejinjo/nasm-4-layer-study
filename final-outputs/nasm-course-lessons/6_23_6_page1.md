# Cancer

**Cancer **is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. It has been estimated that approximately 38.4% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes (Siegel et al., 2019).

Because of better detection and treatment strategies, those living with cancer have improved quality of life and life spans. In recent years, there has been a variety of studies that have documented the positive benefits of exercise in the treatment of cancer, including improved aerobic and muscular fitness, retention of lean body mass, less fatigue, improved quality of life, and positive effects on mood and self-concept (Segal et al., 2017). Because cancer is not a single disease, but a collection of diseases that share the same description (with respect to cell division, accumulation, and death), its signs and symptoms vary widely. This section is only meant to serve as a brief overview of the role of exercise in the prevention and treatment of cancer.

Medications used by clients with cancer can result in substantial adverse effects, including peripheral nerve damage, cardiac and pulmonary problems, skeletal muscle myopathy (muscle weakness and wasting), anemia, and frequent nausea. In addition, the combination of the disease and its treatments frequently result in a diminished quality of life. Fitness professionals must have knowledge of and appreciation for the varied adverse effects of cancer treatments, as they can be substantially greater than the treatments prescribed for most other chronic diseases (**Table 23-1: 9**).

**TABLE 23-19: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Cancer**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Fatigue and weakness is common. | Aerobic exercise should be done at low to moderate intensity (40–50% of peak capacity), 3–5 days per week, using typical aerobic modes (treadmill, elliptical trainer, cycle, depending on patient preference). In particular, avoid higher-intensity training during periods of cancer treatment. |
| Excessive fatigue may result in overall diminished activity. | Use intermittent bouts of exercise to accumulate 20–30 minutes of total aerobic exercise. |
| Cancer may lead to diminished immune function. | Resistance training can be performed (1 set of 8–10 exercises, 10–15 repetitions to fatigue, 2–3 days per week).

Private sessions or less crowded areas are recommended due to immune compromise. |
| Cancer may lead to decreased lean muscle mass. | Assess and provide intervention for decreased range of motion and balance. |

Exercise is an important intervention for clients recovering from cancer. It can improve exercise tolerance, reduce the cellular risks associated with cancer, and improve quality of life (Segal et al., 2017). Specifically, exercise at low to moderate intensities for moderate durations appears to have a more positive effect on the immune system (when compared with higher intensities for longer durations; Brown et al., 2012). Research also indicates that moderate to high levels of physical activity seem to be associated with decreased incidence and mortality rates for certain forms of cancer (Schwartz et al., 2017).
