### EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE

The focus on scientific principles makes NASM’s systems and methodologies safe and effective for any client working toward any fitness goal. Understanding these principles requires fundamental knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, **kinesiology**, fitness assessments, fitness program design, and coaching techniques that help change behavior. To that end, NASM recommends that all fitness professionals maintain a focus on **evidence-based practice** to attain the highest levels of success.

Evidence-based practice is the conscientious use of current best evidence in making decisions about client care. It is defined as any practice (medical or nonmedical) that relies on scientific evidence for guidance and decision-making (Titler, 2008), which means paying attention to what the scientific research is saying, not whatever the current social media trend happens to be. Practices that are not evidence-based may rely more on tradition, intuition, or other unproven methods that cannot be effectively quantified or qualified through the scientific process. There are three fundamental components of evidence-based practice: developing individual professional expertise, staying current on the best sources of external evidence (e.g., peer-reviewed research), and prioritizing client values and expectations (**Figure 1-1**).

For the fitness professional, applying best external evidence represents using relevant research that has been conducted using sound research methods (i.e., peer-reviewed research published in scientific journals). Individual professional expertise refers to the fitness professional’s accumulated education, experience, and practical skills. Client values and expectations are the unique preferences, concerns, goals, and expectations brought by each client to a personal training session. It is the unending integration of these three components that defines a Certified Personal Trainer’s practice as evidence-based.

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Peer-reviewed research is an essential component of the evidence-based practice model. Peer-reviewed research is defined as “a process of subjecting an author’s scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field.”

Peer-reviewed publications act as filters to ensure that only high-quality research is published in reputable journals by determining the validity, significance, and originality of the study (Kelly et al., 2014, p. 227).
