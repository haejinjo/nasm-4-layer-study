#### CRITICAL

With so many in the greater population dealing with one or more chronic health conditions, it is essential for fitness professionals to be familiar with the most common conditions. Regular exercise and healthy lifestyle changes can greatly improve the quality of life for people with chronic conditions; however, fitness professionals should always ensure that affected individuals have received clearance to exercise by a doctor or other licensed healthcare provider before beginning a new fitness regimen.

### OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY

The terms *overweight *and *obesity* refer to a body weight that is greater than what is considered normal or healthy. In both cases, an individual is carrying excess body fat that may negatively impact their health; however, obesity is more severe and has numerous significant health risks associated with it. Being overweight or obese greatly increases the risk of developing a chronic disease, such as musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, cancer, hypertension (high blood pressure), high **cholesterol**, and heart disease (GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators, 2017; World Health Organization, 2018c).

For adults, the general measure used internationally for defining overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI), which is a simple comparison of a person’s height to their weight. It is calculated by either dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of the person’s height in meters or dividing body weight in pounds by the square of the height in inches and multiplying by 703.

	- Metric formula: BMI = weight (kg) ÷ [height (m)]^2^

	- Imperial formula: BMI = 703 × weight (lb) ÷ [height (in.)]^2^

The BMI classifications for overweight and obese are found in **Table 1-1** (Nuttall, 2015).
