## Content
To maintain consistent bone remodeling, people must remain active enough to ensure adequate stress is being placed on their bodies. This is especially important for adolescents and young adults trying to reach peak bone mass.

Other risk factors include a lack of physical activity, smoking, excess alcohol consumption, and low dietary calcium intake (Akkawi & Zmerly, 2018; International Osteoporosis Foundation, 2019). The key for fitness professionals is to recognize that these factors can be positively influenced through a comprehensive health and fitness program (**Table 23-1: 5**). In addition to exercise programs, clients should be encouraged to increase dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, decrease alcohol intake, and cease smoking (Akkawi & Zmerly, 2018; International Osteoporosis Foundation, 2019).

**TABLE 23-15: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Osteoporosis**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Maximal oxygen uptake and ventilatory threshold is frequently lower as a result of chronic deconditioning. | Typical exercise loads prescribed are consistent with fitness standards:   40–70% of maximum work capacity, 3–5 days per week, approximately 20–30 minutes per session. |
| Gait and balance may be negatively affected. | Physiologic and physical limitations point to low-intensity, weight-supported exercise programs that emphasize balance training. |
| Chronic vertebral fractures may result in significant low-back pain. | For clients with osteopenia (and no contraindications to exercise), resistance training is recommended to build bone mass.

Caution is advised to avoid dynamic flexion exercises at the spine.

Loads greater than 75% of 1RM have been shown to improve bone density, but clients must be properly progressed to be able to handle these loads.

A circuit-training format is recommended, 8–10 exercises, 1 set of 8–12 reps per exercise, with rest as needed between sets. |
| Age, disease, physical stature, and deconditioning may place the client at risk for falls. | For clients with severe osteoporosis, exercise modality should be shifted to water exercise to reduce risk of loading fracture.

If aquatic exercise is not feasible, use other weight-supported exercise, such as cycling, and monitor signs and symptoms.

Reinforce other lifestyle behaviors that will optimize bone health, including smoking cessation, reduced alcohol intake, and increased dietary calcium and vitamin D intake. |

^*Note*: 1RM, one-repetition maximum.^

With respect to physical activity, whether a client has osteopenia or osteoporosis, it is important to determine to what degree the client may engage in weight-bearing activities (walking, jogging, dancing, stair climbing, etc.) or resistance training. For example, there is a balance between the benefit of providing exercises that are designed to increase bone mass through the provision of bone stress (weight-bearing exercises or heavier resistance exercises) and the risk of fracture that might be precipitated by advanced osteoporosis. It has been demonstrated that individuals who participate in resistance training have a higher BMD than those who do not (Hong & Kim, 2018).
