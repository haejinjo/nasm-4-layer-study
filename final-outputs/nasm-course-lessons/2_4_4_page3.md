### IMPORTANCE, CONFIDENCE, AND READINESS

The next concept in motivational interviewing is to identify how motivated a client may be to move into the next stage. Fitness professionals can get a relative idea of their clients’ commitment level toward making a change by asking them to rate how ready they are to make it, how confident they are in thinking they can achieve it, and how important the change is to them, all on a simple scale of 1 through 10 (**Figure 4-4**). The answers that fitness professionals receive can help them decide what to do next with the prospective client.

The 10-point grading scale can be viewed similarly to the common grading scheme seen in schools. For example, a 10 being an A+, a 7 being C, and a 5 or below being a fail. With that in mind, any response of a 6 or below (a D or worse) means the client does not have a strong enough commitment surrounding that change metric. This helps to quickly identify clients who will need a bit more coaching to help them move closer to the action and maintenance stages of change. If a client rates importance, confidence, or readiness at a 7 or above, then they are in a good place to start making changes and sticking to them.
