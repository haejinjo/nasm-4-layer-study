## Content
Blood pressure is measured within the **arterial system** while using the **brachial artery** as the standard site of measurement, given its ease of access and the ability to hold the arm level with the position of the heart, which increases the accuracy of measurement (**Figure 11: -7**).

#### GETTING TECHNICAL

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association revised the classification scores for blood pressure and the risk they pose to overall cardiovascular health (Whelton et al., 2018). New research illustrates the usefulness of DBP scores in predicting independent mortality risks in younger adults, while SBP is more important in predicting independent mortality risks in adults older than 50 years.

Blood pressure scores are important because higher scores indicate greater risks for developing cardiovascular disease, which can become life-threatening. Because both SBP and DBP represent pressure within the bloodstream, guidelines have been created that assess this degree of risk (**Table 11: -1**).

### MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE

Blood pressure is traditionally measured using an aneroid sphygmomanometer, which consists of an inflatable cuff, a pressure dial, a bulb with a valve, and a stethoscope; however, digital blood pressure monitors are becoming more popular. 

**TABLE 11-1: Blood Pressure Classification Ranges**

| Classification | Systolic BP | Diastolic BP | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal | <120 mm Hg | <80 mm Hg | Maintain |
| Elevated | 120–129 mm Hg | <80 mm Hg | Lifestyle changes |
| Stage 1 hypertension | 130–139 mm Hg | 80–89 mm Hg | Lifestyle changes + medical monitoring |
| Stage 2 hypertension | ≥140 mm Hg | ≥90 mm Hg | Lifestyle changes + medical monitoring + medications |
| Hypertensive crisis | >180 mm Hg | >120 mm Hg | Seek immediate medical attention |

## Key Terms

**Arterial system**
The system of arteries carrying blood away from the heart.

**Brachial artery**
The primary artery of the upper arm, which is often used as a site for measuring blood pressure.
