### DIABETES

**Diabetes **is a disease that impacts the body’s ability to properly metabolize carbohydrates, specifically **glucose**, the simplest carbohydrate form that is used directly by the cells to produce energy. There are a few types of diabetes, such as type 1 and type 2, and each impacts the body’s physiology differently. With type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin (or none at all), which is a hormone that helps transport glucose into cells to be used for energy. Without insulin, glucose in the blood (i.e., blood sugar) can rise to dangerous levels, causing numerous health complications. Type 1 diabetes is typically genetic and is not something a person can actively prevent. However, regular exercise can help people with type 1 diabetes considerably improve their blood glucose management and quality of life (American Diabetes Association, 2020).

With type 2 diabetes, the body still produces insulin; however, it is not used properly by the cells. When excess carbohydrates (specifically sugar) are chronically consumed in the diet, high levels of insulin need to be produced to help regulate blood sugar. When excess insulin continually tries to deliver glucose to cells when they already have more than they can use, cells stop responding to it. This state is called **insulin resistance**. Once cells have become insulin resistant, a person is said to have developed type 2 diabetes. Regulating blood sugar can become very difficult for these individuals, which may lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels and a wide variety of health complications.

The global economic impact of diagnosing and treating diabetes—especially type 2—is extremely high, as is the human cost of increased disability and premature mortality, making diabetes the seventh leading cause of death around the world (Kharroubi & Darwish, 2015). Regular physical activity and exercise is vital in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, especially type 2 (American Diabetes Association, 2020). Obesity is one of the primary indicators for a person to develop type 2 diabetes; therefore, exercise combined with diet and lifestyle changes to help lose weight can have a dramatic impact in improving the health of individuals who have been diagnosed.

### CANCER

Simply put, **cancer **is a disease where cells in the body grow abnormally, often creating tumors that can grow aggressively and damage the body. Cancer can occur in virtually every part of the body, such as muscle tissue, internal organs, bones, the blood, and the brain. There are more than 100 different types of cancer identified, caused by numerous factors ranging from lifestyle choices like smoking tobacco and eating overly processed meats to acute DNA damage from exposure to radiation (National Cancer Institute, 2015). Cancer can affect people of all ages but is most common in older adults; about 76% of all cancers are diagnosed in individuals 55 years or older (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al., 2019). On the bright side, it is estimated that around 30–50% of cancers can be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies (Bray et al., 2018). Two of those prevention strategies are taking part in regular exercise and eating a healthy diet.

Exercise can play a significant role in the prevention of many types of cancers; in particular, being physically active can reduce the overall risk of cancer in general. Evidence indicates that even those currently undergoing cancer treatments can increase daily physical activity sessions over the course of 1 month (Segal et al., 2017).

In addition to increasing physical activity, all of these activities can significantly reduce cancer risk: avoiding tobacco use, losing excess weight, eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, and limiting alcohol consumption.

## Key Terms

**Glucose**
The simplest form of carbohydrate used by the body for energy.

**Insulin resistance**
The inability of the cells to respond to insulin; occurs in type 2 diabetes.

**Cancer**
A group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.
