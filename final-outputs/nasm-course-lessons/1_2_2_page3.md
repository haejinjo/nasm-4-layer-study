- **Strength and Conditioning Coach**

		- Designs, implements, and coaches workout programs for the specific purpose of improving athletic performance. Strength and conditioning coaches are typically employed by sports organizations or universities and can work with youth, high school, college, recreational, and even professional athletes. Working in this capacity for a university or professional team often requires an advanced degree, fitness industry certification, and internship completion.

	- **Social Media Influencer**

		- Represents and promotes specific products or brands on various social media platforms in exchange for sponsorship. This requires not only an established, professional reputation within the fitness industry and beyond but also the ability to develop, produce, and distribute interesting, engaging content that is relevant to a specific audience and can attract followers to drive brand growth. This is a highly competitive space. Typically, successful fitness influencers will have already earned their platform via previous achievements in athletics or by first building a clientele comprised of high-profile celebrities.

	- **College or Trade School Instructor**

		- Teaches fitness curricula at an accredited college or trade school. This always requires an advanced degree, such as a master’s of science or PhD. Additional training and credentialing in learning theory and instructional design may also be needed to effectively teach at this level.

## Resume Writing

Aspiring fitness professionals need to understand the importance of a well-written resume submitted to hiring managers or business owners. A resume should be a short, outlined presentation of an individual’s ability to contribute to a particular type of organization. In short, it should highlight an entire life, not just work (Schultze, 2010). A new Certified Personal Trainer may not have any specific experience working in the fitness industry, but it is important to highlight other skills and job experiences that can easily transfer.

Selling personal training services to health club members and exhibiting excellent customer service are critical functions of a fitness professional’s job duties. To earn the interview, it is important for applicants to show hiring managers that they are comfortable with customer service and the sales process. Therefore, when writing a resume, fitness professionals should feature any and all professional experience that relates to sales and customer service. For example, if an applicant has experience working as a server in a restaurant, then it is important to highlight that specific work experience because it demonstrates the ability to approach customers and upsell additional products like appetizers or desserts.

### HELPFUL HINT

When writing a resume, fitness professionals should highlight how previous jobs have provided the experience in customer service that they need to be successful. To stand out, they should describe personal activities that are interesting and will catch a reader’s attention (Schultze, 2010).

**The resume should be**:

**Creative**. It should provide an accurate employment history in the most creative way. “Word-smithing” the descriptions of previous work experience could help a candidate stand out to a potential employer.

**Organized**. The resume is a representation of the job seeker. It should be well structured with a consistent flow of information that shows an attention to detail. The use of action verbs will highlight accomplishments at previous jobs.

**Unconventional**. The resume should feature experience related to a fitness professional. For example, working as a counselor in a youth camp shows the ability to lead large groups of people.

**Vulnerable**. The fitness professional should be honest and show the ability to learn and grow in a position by highlighting both successes and failures.
