## Content
Therefore, each cable exercise must match the muscle’s natural line of pull. For example, when performing a biceps curl (elbow flexion), the cable should be positioned to offer resistance in a vertical motion against elbow flexion (pulling the elbow into extension) (**Figure 22: -3**). However, with a standing triceps extension exercise (**Figure 22: -4**), the resistance must be placed in such a way to resist elbow extension (pulling the elbow into flexion). During a standing cable row that requires shoulder extension and scapular retraction, the resistance should be positioned to pull the shoulders into flexion and scapular protraction (**Figure 22: -5**). During the standing cable chest press (shoulder horizontal adduction), the resistance should be positioned to pull the shoulders into horizontal abduction (**Figure 22: -6**).

Because cable machines can be used in a variety of fashions similar to free weights and by virtually all populations, they can be effectively used in all phases of the OPT model.
