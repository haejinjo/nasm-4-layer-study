## Content
## Squat Jump

---

### TECHNIQUE

Make sure to land with the ankles, knees, and hips flexed and pointed straight ahead, which becomes the takeoff position as well. This will ensure optimal joint mechanics and muscle recruitment. Perform the exercise with a repetitive (medium) tempo.

## Lunge Jump

---

### TECHNIQUE

Make sure to keep the front foot pointed straight ahead during takeoff and landing. Do not allow the front foot to externally or internally rotate. Also, keep the front knee pointed straight. Do not allow the front knee to cave inward during the landing, as this can cause stress to the connective tissue within the knee.
