## Content
- **Realistic**

		- Realistic goals are relevant to the client’s life. Even though something may be technically possible, it may not be possible for a particular client when viewed in the context of their lifestyle. For example, it may be unrealistic for a busy business owner, who works 10 or more hours per day, to lose 100 pounds (45 kg) in 6 months. It is up to the fitness professional to make sure that client expectations are managed accordingly.

	- **Timely**

		- To properly measure and track goals, they need to have specific timeframes with frequent check ins. The timeframe to complete a goal should be as challenging and realistic as the intended outcome. It should be short enough to build urgency, but long enough to allow for one or two slip-ups along the way.

If a goal fails to meet any of the SMART criteria, it will likely fail to meet the needs of the client, potentially leading to a lapse in exercise adherence and even the loss of a client. An example of a goal that is not SMART could be, “I want to lose some weight so that I look better on the beach this summer.” This goal has no specific outcome defined, no way to track progress or know how it will be accomplished, and a vague completion window, and depending on the beginning state of the client’s fitness, it may or may not be attainable and realistic within their lifestyle. To better serve that client, the goal could be reframed to, “I want to lose 5 pounds (2.2 kg) of body fat in 6 months, by running for 1 hour per day, 4 days per week in my free time after the workday is over.”

##### TRY THIS

Writing SMART goals is not an easy process and takes practice. Try setting SMART goals for yourself. To help with this process be sure all components of a SMART goal are accounted for. Examples of SMART goals include the following:

	- I will gain 5 pounds (2.27 kg) of muscle within 5 months, starting today, by weight lifting a minimum of 4 days per week for 1 hour each session.

	- I will reduce my blood pressure by five points within 6 months by walking a minimum of 30 minutes each day and reducing my daily salt intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams per day.

	- I will lose 10 pounds (4.53 kg) of body fat within 3 months by reducing my daily calories from 3,000 to 2,000 per day and exercising at a moderate intensity at a minimum of 150 minutes per week.

Each example above specifically details the intended outcome with objectively measurable and trackable criteria that are bound to a realistic timeframe in which the goal can be reasonably attained.

#### OUTCOME VERSUS PROCESS GOALS

**Outcome goals** refer to goal consequences. They represent the final achievement that hard work will inevitably lead to, such as winning a race or seeing a desired weight on the scale. **Process goals** refer to the daily and weekly tasks that need to be done to reach that final outcome. Once an outcome goal has been set, process goals should be created that speak to how they are going to achieve that outcome.

For example, if an individual has an outcome goal of winning a 10K race competition within 1 year, a process goal to serve that final outcome could be to jog for 1 hour 3 days per week and attend two personal training sessions per week. Additionally, similar process goals would then be created to set progress milestones. The most effective goal setting will always use process goals to lead the way toward completing an outcome goal.
