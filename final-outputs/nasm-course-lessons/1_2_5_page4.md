### FOUR P'S OF MARKETING

A marketing plan should identify business opportunities and how to attract business in a specific market environment. For a health club employee, a market could simply be the members at the health club; for an independent Certified Personal Trainer, it could be all of the residents in a specific neighborhood or households in a community. The marketing plan will help determine the most effective way to promote the services offered by the Certified Personal Trainer, which will differ based on the specific market the Certified Personal Trainer is working in. To help simplify the process, fitness professionals should consider the Four P's of marketing, also known as the marketing mix: product, price, promotion, and place. A marketing plan should address the Four P's by:

	- Communicating the benefits of using a *product*

	- Identifying a competitive *price* of the service

	- Determining how the service will be *promoted*

	- Selecting the *place* or method of distribution (Westwood, 2016)
