## Content
Some also contain stimulants, such as caffeine and green tea extract, along with various vitamins and minerals. Sports drinks are helpful in facilitating rehydration and, in some cases, help the replenishment of glycogen stores during prolonged training lasting for more than an hour. For shorter training sessions less than an hour, especially when perspiration is low or minimal, water is likely sufficient for fluid replenishment. Some sports drinks contain large amounts of sugar and may be an unnecessary source of extra calories in an individual’s diet if training volume is low.

There are many different sports drinks available on the market today with varying compositions of carbohydrate and electrolytes.

Sports drinks can be **hypotonic**, **isotonic**, or **hypertonic** based on the concentration of electrolytes and carbohydrates in the solution (**Table 9-20**). Hypotonic drinks have a lower concentration of salt and electrolytes compared to the human body. Isotonic drinks have a similar concentration of salt and electrolytes as in a human body. Hypertonic drinks have higher concentrations of salt and electrolytes; they are absorbed more quickly than isotonic or hypotonic solutions. Most sports drinks on the market are either hypotonic or isotonic solutions. However, hypertonic solutions may be appropriate under certain conditions.

Adequate hydration remains essential for optimal health, training, and performance. Fitness professionals should emphasize the importance of hydration with all clients, highlighting the physiological importance of fluid for blood flow, maintenance of body temperature, blood volume, the disposal of waste matter, and the importance for training and performance. Inadequate hydration prior to training can affect training intensity and lead to higher body temperature, a higher rate of perceived exertion, and decreased cardiac output. Clients may also find it difficult to maintain training intensity and volume. Hydration during exercise and posttraining should also be emphasized to replace fluid and electrolyte losses and enhance recovery from training sessions, particularly with clients who are engaged in high-volume exercise or training for sports performance.

**TABLE 9-20 Sports Drinks**

| Type of Sports Drink | Most Appropriate Usage |
|---|---|
| Hypotonic | Fluid replenishment is a greater priority than carbohydrate or electrolyte replacement |
| Isotonic | Activities lasting more than 60 minutes

Moderate fluid and electrolyte losses

Moderate perspiration |
| Hypertonic | High-volume and intense training lasting more than 60–90 minutes

Large fluid and electrolyte losses

Heavy perspiration

Higher priority for carbohydrate and electrolyte replacement (versus fluid replacement only) |

# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Hypertonic sports drinks have a higher concentration of salts and electrolytes and, therefore, a higher concentration than body fluids. They are also absorbed more quickly than either isotonic or hypotonic solutions. The higher concentration and rapid rate of absorption can cause gastrointestinal upset in some individuals. If gastrointestinal upset is a concern, then using an isotonic sports drink or watering down a hypertonic sports drink may mitigate these effects.

## Key Terms

**Hypotonic**
A solution with a lower solute load/concentration than body fluids.

**Isotonic**
A solution with a similar solute load/concentration as body fluids.

**Hypertonic**
A solution with a higher solute load/concentration than body fluids.
