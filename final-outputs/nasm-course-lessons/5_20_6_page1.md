# Guidelines for Resistance Training

Resistance exercises are an integral component of any exercise training program because they help ensure optimal joint stability, muscular endurance, strength, power, and coordinated movement. Moreover, resistance exercises can be an effective mode meant for increasing lean muscle mass, reducing body fat, enhancing athletic performance, and improving numerous health markers (Ciolac & Rodrigues-Da-Silva, 2016; Schoenfeld, Ogborn, et al., 2016; Westcott, 2012). Programming resistance training exercises must be systematic and progressive. As such, fitness professionals should follow specific program guidelines, including proper exercise selection criteria and milestones for progression (**Table 20-11**).
