# Introduction to Supplements

Dietary supplements and the concepts of performance- and wellness-enhancing foods or substances have been around for thousands of years. Ayurvedic medicine has been practiced in India as early as 6,000 BC, whereas Roman gladiators may have consumed their own type of recovery shake, composed of plant ash, since 300 BC (Losch et al., 2014; Mackenzie & Rakel, 2006). Modern-day supplements originated in the 1940s with a multivitamin supplement, and the dietary supplement industry grew to generate $115 billion of revenue worldwide in 2018, most of which continue to be vitamin and mineral sales (Grand View Research, 2019).

Coupled with the fact that the variety of supplements offered has broadened to include a great deal of fitness-related products, it is important for the fitness professional to have a general understanding of dietary supplements and their uses, regulations, and capabilities.

## STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Carl Rehnborg developed the first multivitamin product while living in China after observing micronutrient deficiencies. His business, Nutrilite, began in California in 1939. Carl also invented the concept of multilevel marketing to help sell the product, a technique that is still used by some supplement, fitness, homecare, and cosmetic companies today.
