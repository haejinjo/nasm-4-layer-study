### Static Soleus Stretch 

#### TECHNIQUE

Stand in a lunge position with both feet pointing straight forward and back knee slightly flexed. Make sure to keep the rear foot flat on the ground. Do not let the heel rise up. Shift weight forward until a stretch is felt in the rear calf muscle.

### Static 90/90 Hamstring Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Lie supine with one hip flexed 90 degrees (target leg) and the opposite leg straight and flat on the floor. Straighten the target leg until a mild stretch is felt in the hamstrings. The use of a rope or band is suggested. The stretch should not cause pain or extreme discomfort.
