### Static Supine Biceps Femoris Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Lie supine with one hip flexed 90 degrees (target leg) and the opposite leg straight and flat on the floor. Next, adduct the target leg across the body and extend the knee until a mild stretch is felt in the lateral hamstrings. The stretch should not cause pain or extreme discomfort. Keep both shoulders flat on the ground during this stretch. Avoid rotating the torso toward the stretched leg.

### Static Standing Biceps Femoris Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Use a low box or step to perform this stretch. Place one leg on top of the box in an adducted and internally rotated position. Then, locking the hands together, slowly rotate the torso in the opposite direction. The stretched leg does not need to be elevated above hip height. This stretch emphasizes the lateral hamstring.
