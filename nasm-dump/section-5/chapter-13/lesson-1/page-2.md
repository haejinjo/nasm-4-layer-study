# Integrated Training Principles

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary (2019), to integrate means to “form, coordinate, or blend into a functioning or unified whole.” In the world of food, a common lunch menu item is the chef salad (**Figure 13-1**). When we mix together or form this salad, the ingredients are as follows: lettuce as the base, hard-boiled eggs, deli ham, deli turkey, tomatoes, cucumbers, and cheese. This integrated approach to a salad shows that many ingredients can be included in this dish to provide a flavorful and enjoyable experience. At any point, this salad can be customized to the likes of the person who wants to eat it. For example, a patron who is lactose-intolerant can substitute the cheese with extra eggs or croutons, or a vegan can substitute more vegetables in replacement of eggs and deli meat.

An exercise program can follow a similar strategy. For instance, just like removing cheese from the chef salad, fitness professionals can opt out of heavy squatting to accommodate a client who was recently released from physical therapy due to a knee injury. Instead, the fitness professional can substitute core and balance drills to make that training session more tailored to their client’s needs and abilities. When fitness professionals take an integrated approach to exercise, their programs become well balanced while reducing boredom and can maximize results.
