# SUMMARY

Using integrated training principles, the fitness professional will have the ability to provide a better approach to personal training, providing their clients with an array of training strategies that are unified and tailored to the clientsâ€™ specific health and fitness goals. Integrated training combines multiple forms of exercise into one progressive system and includes the following:

	- Flexibility training

	- Cardiorespiratory training

	- Core training

	- Balance training

	- Plyometric (reactive) training

	- SAQ training

	- Resistance training

Leveraging these integrated training concepts, when selecting exercises and designing programs, will help the fitness professional to plan and execute a client-centric approach to fitness training.

The NASM OPT model provides a system for properly and safely progressing any client toward their goals by using integrated training methods consisting of three levels: stabilization, strength, and power.

The stabilization level has one phase of training:

	- Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training

The strength level has three phases of training:

	- Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training

	- Phase 3 Muscular Development Training

	- Phase 4 Maximum Strength Training

The power level has one phase of training:

	- Phase 5 Power Training

All the phases of training within the OPT model have been specifically designed to maximize human performance and potential. It provides an easy-to-follow systematic progression that minimizes injury while maximizing results.
