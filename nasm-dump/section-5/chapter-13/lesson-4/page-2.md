### CHAPTER REVIEW

Using integrated training principles, Certified Personal Trainers will discover many new and exciting exercises, movements, and other variables to add to their professional toolbox. As a result, fitness professionals will be able to create customized exercise programs for their clients that provide psychological, physiological, body composition, and performance benefits.

Most exercises involve at least one of the following movement patterns, whereas others may combine multiple movement patterns into a single exercise:

	- Squat

	- Hip hinge

	- Pulling motions

	- Pushing motions

	- Pressing

One primary goal for the fitness professional is to create progressive and systematic exercise programs that inherently maintain or correct posture and ROM. In addition, exercise programs should involve training in all planes of motion, manipulation of acute training variables (e.g., sets, repetition, rest periods), correlation of assessment results, and use of integrated training components: flexibility, cardiorespiratory, core, balance, plyometric, SAQ, and resistance training.

Flexibility training increases joint ROM and involves different types of stretching techniques to improve tissue extensibility. NASM recommends using a variety of stretching techniques, including self-myofascial techniques (such as foam rolling), static stretching, active stretching, and dynamic stretching.

Cardiorespiratory training refers to the capacity of respiratory and cardiovascular systems to provide muscles with oxygen during sustained and/or intense exercise. Typical forms of cardiorespiratory exercise include walking, jogging, running, cycling, biking, swimming, rowing and sports competition.

Core training enhances posture; strengthens muscles of the abdomen, low-back, and pelvis; and can minimize low-back pain. In addition, core training improves athletic ability and rotational power of the torso.

Balance training is a method that can create better movement patterns for all clients and reduce the occurrence of falls in the elderly and ankle sprains for athletes.

Plyometric training is also known as reactive or jump training. Plyometric exercise improves the stretch-shortening cycle, which enhances a clientâ€™s ability to move explosively.

SAQ training enhances the capability of individuals to be more skillful at faster speeds and with greater precision. SAQ training aims to improve acceleration, deceleration, and change of direction abilities.
