**Core Training for Rehabilitation and Sport Performance**

	- Linde et al. (2018) found that abdominal bracing during a single-leg squatting task led to greater activity of the global abdominal muscles in healthy females when compared to abdominal hollowing and control conditions.

	- Motealleh et al. (2019) evaluated trunk postural balance on an unstable sitting platform in young women with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). They found impaired trunk postural control in the women with PFPS, suggesting that rehabilitation for these patients should incorporate isolated core training to improve recovery and function.

	- Tsai et al. (2019) investigated whether core training through control and strength of the trunk and hip would improve landing biomechanics and muscle strength in adolescent male volleyball athletes. Following a 6-week core training program, athletes demonstrated a more controlled (upright) trunk posture during landing and improved strength of key hip and knee musculature, suggesting that core training may be important to incorporate into training programs for jumping athletes.

	- Lima et al. (2018) found that adults with a history of LBP and disability who underwent a 10-week core and mobility training program, including guidelines for the most appropriate core posture during work and activities of daily living, had reduced LBP intensity perception and low-back functional disability compared to individuals who did not follow this program.

	- Sung et al. (2016) demonstrated that an integrated and specialized 8-week core training and nondominant arm strength training program resulted in larger improvements in drive distance compared to golfers who did no exercise or core-only exercise for 8 weeks.

**Key Takeaways**

	- Abdominal bracing during a single-leg squatting leads to greater activity of the global abdominal muscles.

	- Rehabilitation for patients with PFPS should incorporate core training.

	- Core training may improve landing mechanics after jumping.

	- Core exercises can help reduce LBP.

	- Core training can improve golf performance.

## Designing a Core Training Program

The goal of core training is to develop optimal levels of stability, muscular endurance, strength, and power. Increasing proprioceptive demand by using a multisensory environment and using multiple exercise modalities (balls, bands, balance equipment) is more important than increasing the external resistance. The quality of movement should be emphasized more than quantity, and the focus of the program should be on coordinated movement across the kinetic chain.

### CRITICAL

Neural adaptations become the focus of the program instead of striving for absolute strength gains.

The following is an example of an integrated core training program. The client begins at the highest level at which they are able to maintain stability and optimal coordinated movement. The client progresses through their program after mastering the exercises in the previous level while simultaneously demonstrating intervertebral and lumbopelvic stability. To evaluate appropriate intervertebral stability, the client will be able to maintain the drawing-in position while performing various exercises. The client would have appropriate lumbopelvic stability when they are able to perform functional movement patterns, such as squats, lunges, and step-ups,Â without excessive spinal motion.
