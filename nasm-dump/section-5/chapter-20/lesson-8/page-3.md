## Content
### Barbell Bench Press

---

#### TECHNIQUE

During this exercise, the feet should remain in contact with the floor, whereas the buttocks, shoulders, and head must remain in contact with the bench. The use of weight plates underneath the feet is acceptable if the client cannot reach the floor, due to height limitations.

### Medicine Ball Chest Pass

---

#### TECHNIQUE

If the ability to perform power exercises with a medicine ball is not an option, because of equipment or facility limitations, this exercise can also be done using tubing or a cable apparatus. Make sure to adjust the weight or resistance accordingly, so the client can still perform the movement quickly and under control without compensation.
