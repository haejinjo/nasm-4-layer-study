### Squat Jump

---

#### SAFETY

Landing with the knees caved inward is dangerous and can lead to pain and injury. Make sure your clients display optimal landing mechanics, with their feet pointed straight ahead and knees tracking over the second and third toes.

### Tuck Jump

---

#### TECHNIQUE

When performing jumping exercises, make sure your clients land just behind the ball of their foot, rather than onÂ the ball of the foot or on the heel. This will ensure proper force distribution through the foot and lower extremities, thus improving force production capabilities.
