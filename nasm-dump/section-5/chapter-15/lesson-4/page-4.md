#### STAGE 2 STEADY-STATE AEROBIC EXERCISE 

Once clients become accustomed to stage 2 intervals and have shown positive signs of adapting to the physical demands, they can begin performing moderately intense steady-state cardio exercise above VT1, if desired. In other words, the client can perform aerobic conditioning in zone 2 just above VT1 for the duration of the exercise session without the use of intervals. It is important to note that stage 2 steady-state aerobic exercise is not a requirement, but rather an option for clients who prefer to perform steady-state aerobic exercise instead of intervals. Mod­erately intense aerobic activity has been proven effective for individuals seeking improvements in fitness and cardiovascular health (Haskell et al., 2007).

An example stage 2 steady-state workout can proceed as follows (**Figure 15-3**):

	- Start by warming up for 5–10 minutes in zone 1.

	- Increase intensity (e.g., speed, incline) until client reaches zone 2, which is just above VT1.

	- Continue the duration of the exercise session at this intensity.

	- Cool down in zone 1 for 5–10 minutes.

##### CRITICAL

For most weight-loss clients and those new to exercise, stages 1 and 2 are most appropriate and effective for improving health and wellness and promoting a healthy body weight. These two stages should be top priority for the average exerciser and gym goer.

Stages 3 through 5 are most appropriate for athletes and advanced fitness enthusiasts who are seeking greater improvements in cardiorespiratory conditioning and are willing to participate in high-intensity exercise. It is not necessary for fitness professionals to implement all five stages with their clients. Cardiorespiratory exercise should be individualized based on the client’s needs, goals, abilities, and exercise preferences.

### STAGE 3 

Stage 3 is for the moderately advanced client who has obtained a satisfactory cardiorespiratory fitness base. Stage 3 training increases the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic energy systems and is applicable for clients seeking further improvements in exercise capacity. Research demon­strates that high-intensity interval training is a time-efficient strategy to increase physical fitness (Sultana et al., 2019).

However, stage 3 is not appropriate for all clients. Clients seeking only modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, those who are new to exercise, and individuals who are averse to high-intensity training can skip stage 3 training.
