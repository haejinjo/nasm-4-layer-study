# Introduction to Stage Training

Cardiorespiratory training, as with any other form of training, falls under the **principle of specificity**. According to the principle of specificity, the body will adapt to the level of stress placed on it and will then require more or varied amounts of stress to produce a higher level of adaptation in the future. For example, a client who begins jogging for 30 minutes 5 days per week will, over time, become more aerobically fit. Consequently, this individual will need to increase the duration or intensity of each jogging session to experience continual fitness im­provements. To accomplish this goal, cardiorespiratory exercise programs should be tailored to the individual, using their own unique metabolic markers (e.g., ventilatory threshold) as a guide for proposing exercise intensities.

## Stage Training

The purpose of stage training is to ensure that cardiorespiratory training programs progress in an organized fashion to ensure continual adaptation and minimize the risk of overtraining and injury. The five stages of cardiorespiratory training discussed in this chapter use different inten­sities (training zones). Each of the four training zones target a specific outcome while remaining customizable for clients (**Table 15-10**). As a result, stage training is appropriate for new exercis­ers, fitness enthusiasts, and performance athletes.

**TABLE 15-10 Training Zones**

| Training Zone | Metabolic Marker | RPE (1–10 scale) | RPE (6–20 scale) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 | Below VT1 | 3–4 | 12–13 | Light to moderate
	Starting to sweat but can still carry on a conversation effortlessly |
| Zone 2 | VT1 to Midpoint* | 5–6 | 14–15 | Challenging to hard
	Noticeable sweating and using larger volumes of breath
	Continual talking is becoming challenging |
| Zone 3 | Midpoint to VT2 | 7–8 | 16–17 | Vigorous to very hard
	Profuse sweating
	Vigorous breathing and ability to talk is limited to short phrases |
| Zone 4 | Above VT2 | 9–10 | 18–20 | Very hard to maximum effort
	Breathing as hard as possible
	Speaking is impossible or limited to grunts of single words |

^*Midpoint: The intensity level halfway between VT1 and VT2.^

## Key Terms

**Principle of specificity**
A principle stating that the body will adapt to the specific demands that are placed on it; also known as the Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands (SAID) principle.
