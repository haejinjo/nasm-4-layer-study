## Content
Stage 2 is the introduction to aerobic interval training in which intensities are varied throughout the workout. A stage 2 workout consists of a mix of recovery intervals just below VT1 (or a score of “moderate to challenging” when using RPE) and work intervals performed at an intensity just above VT1 (or a score of “challenging to hard” when using RPE). Interval training in this manner will likely improve both physical fitness (e.g., increased VO~2max~) and health markers, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (Ito, 2019).

For example, if a client’s heart rate at VT1 is 145 bpm, they should perform exercise intervals slightly above 145 bpm and recovery intervals just below 145 bpm. However, using RPE to gauge exercise intensity is an effective alternative if a heart rate monitor is not available.

Stage 2 work intervals should start out relatively brief (e.g., 30–60 seconds) and progress in duration and intensity over time. Work-to-rest ratios of 1:3, 1:2, and 1:1 are appropriate for stage 2 training. For example, a 1:3 work-to-rest ratio involving a 1-minute interval just above VT1 would include 3 minutes of recovery below VT1. The duration and intensity of intervals should be gradually increased as the client’s fitness levels improve. For example, a 1-minute work interval can be increased to 2 or 3 minutes. In addition, work-to-rest ratios should progress in difficulty from 1:3 to 1:2 to eventually 1:1. These progressions should be based on the ability and willingness of the client to perform higher-intensity exercise.

#### EXAMPLE STAGE 2 AEROBIC INTERVAL PROGRAM

Stage 2 exercise programs should be individualized and tailored to meet the needs and goals of the client. Following is one example of a stage 2 cardiorespiratory program (**Figure 15-2**):

	- Start by warming up for 5–10 minutes.

	- Move into a 1-minute interval in zone 2 that is just above VT1.

	- After the 1-minute interval, return to zone 1 for 3 minutes.

	- Repeat these intervals until the duration of the exercise session is complete.

	- Cool down for 5–10 minutes.

For clients new to interval training, it is a good idea to alternate stage 1 and stage 2 workouts. For example, start with stage 1 on Monday, then move to stage 2 on Wednesday, and go back to stage 1 on Friday. The next week, start with stage 2 and so on. Rotate the stages to keep workouts balanced. This will become very important in stage 3. However, this plan is only a general guide and may be changed based on the client’s training schedule, available recovery time, and unfore­seen external stressors, such as lack of sleep.
