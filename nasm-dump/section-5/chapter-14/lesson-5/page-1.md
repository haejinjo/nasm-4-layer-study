# Static Stretching

Static stretching is the process of passively taking a muscle to the point of tension and holding the stretch for a minimum of 30 seconds (Behm & Chaouachi, 2011). This is a traditional form of stretching that is most often used in current fitness professions. It combines low force with longer duration stretch times (Thomas et al., 2018). By holding the muscle in a stretched position for a prolonged period, the muscle spindle becomes inhibited resulting in a relaxation response. This allows the muscle to relax and provides for a better lengthening reaction (**Table 14-5**) (Thomas et al., 2018). In fact, static stretching may impact many sensory mechanisms within the nervous system to facilitate a greater **stretch tolerance**. In addition, contracting the antagonistic musculature while holding the stretch can reciprocally inhibit the muscle being stretched, allowing it to relax and enhance the effectiveness of the stretch. For example, when performing the kneeling hip flexor stretch, an individual can contract the hip extensors (gluteus maximus) to reciprocally inhibit the hip flexors (psoas, rectus femoris), allowing for greater lengthening of these muscles (Lempke et al., 2018). Another example would be to contract the quadriceps when performing a hamstring stretch. Static stretching should be used to decrease the muscle spindle activity of an overactive muscle before and after activity. Various static stretching techniques are described in the following section.

**TABLE 14-5 Static Stretching Summary**

| Type of Stretch | Mechanism of Action | Training Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Static stretch | Stretch tolerance and/or reciprocal inhibition (depending how stretch is performed) | 1–3 sets

Hold each stretch for 30 seconds |

## Key Terms

**Stretch tolerance**
The ability to experience the physical sensations of stretching to reduce the discomfort felt at the end range of motion.
