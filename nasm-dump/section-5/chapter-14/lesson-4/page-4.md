### SMR: Hamstrings

#### TECHNIQUE

While sitting, the target leg is straight with the roller underneath the posterior thigh, and the opposite knee is flexed. Roll along the length of the muscle. Avoid rolling over the knee joint. Using a massage ball instead of a foam roller is a progression for this exercise and can help pinpoint tender areas.

### SMR: Quadriceps

#### TECHNIQUE

The client is in the plank position with knees straight and roller under the quadriceps. Roll along the length of the muscle. This exercise can be performed bilaterally (both legs) or unilaterally (one leg at a time). Avoid rolling over the knee joint.

### SMR: Adductors

#### TECHNIQUE

To perform this technique correctly, the foam roller should be placed perpendicular to the inner thigh. Roll the length of the muscle. Avoid rolling over the knee joint.
