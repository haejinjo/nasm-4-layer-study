### Leg Swings: Side to Side

#### TECHNIQUE

In standing position, swing one leg in a controlled pendulum fashion from side to side. Like front to back hip swings, keep a tall, upright posture with the abdominals drawn in during the duration of the exercise.

### Frankenstein

#### TECHNIQUE

This technique is performed while walking forward with arms stretched out away from the body. Only lift each leg as high as can be safely controlled while maintaining ideal posture. Keep a neutral back without leaning to the left or right. This exercise helps stretch the hamstrings.

### High Knee

#### TECHNIQUE

This technique is performed while walking forward. With each step, flex the hip as high as can be controlled, grasping the knee at the top with both hands. Be sure to pause at the top and switch legs with each step.
