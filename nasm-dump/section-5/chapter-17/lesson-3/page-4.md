## Content
The last progression includes exercises that are designed to develop proper deceleration ability to move the body from a dynamic state to a controlled stationary position. In other words, these exercises combine hopping motions with a single-leg stance landing (holding the landing position for 3–5 seconds). Exercises in this level include (but are not limited to) the following:

	- Multiplanar hop with stabilization

	- Multiplanar single-leg box hop-up with stabilization

	- Multiplanar single-leg box hop-down with stabilization

#### TRAINING TIP

The preceding paragraphs described methods for progressing balance exercises by increasing demands to body position and limb movement.

To reiterate:

**Progression 1**. Exercises should initially involve little joint motion of the balance leg.

	- Once these types of exercises have been mastered, a fitness professional can choose to make these exercises more challenging (if deemed appropriate) by integrating the following:

		- Balance modalities (e.g., balance beam, half-foam roll, foam pad, balance disc, wobble board)

		- Cognitive, dual-task scenarios (e.g., naming the months of the year while balancing on one limb)

		- Closing eye tasks

		- Head or eye movement

**Progression 2**. Exercises should involve movement of the balance leg through a full range of motion.

	- Once these types of exercises have been mastered, a fitness professional can again choose to make these exercises more challenging (if deemed appropriate) by integrating the following:

		- Balance modalities

		- Cognitive, dual-task scenarios

		- Closing eye tasks

		- Head or eye movement

**Progression 3**. Exercises should combine hopping motions with a single-leg stance landing, and holding the balance position for 3–5 seconds.

	- Once these types of exercises have been mastered, a fitness professional can again choose to make these exercises more challenging (if deemed appropriate) by integrating the following:

		- Balance modalities

		- Cognitive, dual-task scenarios

		- Closing eye tasks

		- Head or eye movement

It is important to plan exercise progressions to challenge the balance system by manipulating one variable at a time. The progressions implemented should be client-specific based on their own unique physical capabilities.

### FIVE KINETIC CHAIN CHECKPOINTS

As with any training method, proper form and technique must be mastered to ensure proper muscle activation and to avoid injury. The skill required for balance training requires adequate focus and conscious attention during regular practice, especially to minimize the risk of falls while ensuring the lower limbs and trunk remain in ideal posture. As with all exercises, quality should always come before quantity or weight progression, and the five kinetic chain checkpoints should be monitored (see **Figure 17-4**):

	- *Feet *pointing straight ahead

	- *Knees* in line with the second and third toes (avoid allowing knees to cave inward)

	- *Hips *level and in a neutral position

	- *Shoulders* in a neutral position (not protracted or elevated)

	- *Head* with cervical spine in a neutral position (chin tuck)
