## Content
Maintaining balance in these various conditions requires integration of multiple systems, including vision, **vestibular**, and **somatosensory** systems, as well as properly timed muscle contractions, to maintain the center of mass within the limits of stability. The ability to maintain balance during various conditions is important for optimizing performance, reducing injury risk, and enhancing rehabilitation efforts. Thus, it is important for fitness professionals to understand the mechanisms and benefits of balance training as a vital component of care for all clients.

There may be many reasons why an individual has impaired balance. In general, an individual with a musculoskeletal injury (i.e., a ligament sprain or a muscle pull) or an alteration of **sensorimotor functio****n** (i.e., due to a concussion or the normal process of aging) may have deficits in balance and likely benefits from balance training programs (Frankel et al., 2006; Lecci et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019; Terada et al., 2019). The fitness professional can improve clientsâ€™ functionality across the spectrum of health and wellness by using individualized, comprehensive, and systematic balance training programs.

## Key Terms

**Vestibular system**
Provides information about the position of the body and head, and spatial orientation relative to its surrounding environment; located in the inner ears that assist with balance.

**Somatosensory system**
Provides information that is acquired from receptors in the body (skin, muscle, joints, tendons) about the position and motion of the body parts relative to other body regions and the support surface.

**Sensorimotor function**
The interaction between the way the body processes visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information with the motor response of the body to that information.
