## Content
It is important to note that agility and change of direction (COD) are separate, although both of these related concepts fit underneath the umbrella of agility training. Agility involves reacting to a signal, or stimulus and then changing the body’s sprinting direction in response to that stimulus. A good example of this concept is of a coach instructing an athlete to run in various directions (e.g., shuffle left, shuffle right, forward, backward) in no discernable order, by pointing in various directions. This requires the athlete to react to the coach’s cues and respond accordingly. Conversely, COD does not involve reacting to a signal, but it still requires an individual to accelerate, decelerate, and change directions, such as an athlete running through a predetermined obstacle course (Young et al., 2015). This differentiation is important as fitness professionals design agility drills, which should involve a response to a signal versus only working on COD.

#### HELPFUL HINT

Change of direction (COD) requires a client or athlete to run in all directions at maximum speeds. As such, it requires optimal body control and coordination. Examples of COD include running through an obstacle course or performing predetermined cone drills.

Agility combines COD with unpredictability. In other words, it requires a client or athlete to react to a stimulus and sprint accordingly in the proper direction. An example would be a group of school children playing a game of tag.

## Speed

Speed is the ability to move the body in one direction as fast as possible. It is the product of stride rate and stride length (Bailey et al., 2017; Barnes & Kilding, 2015; Moore, 2016; Van Oeveren et al., 2017). **Stride rate** is the number of strides taken in a given amount of time (or distance). **Stride length** is the distance covered in one stride, during running. Although certain aspects of speed are dependent on genetic factors, it is a skill that can be learned through an integrated training program (Salonikidis & Zafeiridis, 2008). Not every client needs to run as fast as an elite athlete, but speed improvements among athletic and nonathletic clients can have both performance and health-related advantages. Speed-specific exercises (i.e., sprinting drills) stimulate muscle tissue and nerves in ways that other training methods do not and thus can stimulate health and performance adaptations that will be missed if it is not included in a fitness training program.

### PROPER SPRINT MECHANICS

Proper running mechanics enable the client to maximize force generation through biomechanical efficiency, allowing maximal movement velocity to be achieved in the shortest time possible. Two important aspects of sprint technique are frontside and backside mechanics. **Frontside mechanics** involve *triple flexion*, which includes the synchronized movement of ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, and hip flexion. Improved frontside mechanics are associated with better stability, less braking force, and increased forward driving force. Proper frontside mechanics align the lead leg to optimally apply force into the ground to help propel the body forward. **Backside mechanics** involve *triple extension*, which includes the synchronized movement of ankle plantar flexion, knee extension, and hip extension.

## Key Terms

**Stride rate**
The number of strides taken in a given amount of time (or distance).

**Stride length**
The distance covered with each stride during the gait cycle.

**Frontside mechanics**
Proper alignment of the lead leg and pelvis during sprinting, which includes ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, hip flexion, and a neutral pelvis.

**Backside mechanics**
Proper alignment of the rear leg and pelvis during sprinting, which includes ankle plantarflexion, knee extension, hip extension, and a neutral pelvis.
