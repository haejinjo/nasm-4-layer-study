## SAQ Training for Weight Loss

Interval training in which participants exhibit short, repeated bouts of high-intensity activity has been found to be highly effective in improving a variety of health-related factors. High-intensity, short-duration programs have been found to match (and sometimes surpass) results for functional capacity, muscular power, fat and weight loss, and other metabolic adaptations when compared with moderate-intensity, long-duration exercise protocols, such as jogging (Gibala et al., 2006; Iaia et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2001; Talanian et al., 2007; Tjønna et al., 2008; Trembley et al., 1994; Wewege et al., 2017). The high-intensity, short bouts of SAQ drills make them a valid choice for interval training modalities with appropriate nonathletic populations. The variety of exercises provided through the incorporation of SAQ training can increase participants’ adherence by making a program fun and engaging (Jakicic et al., 1995). Although athletes use these drills to improve their sport-specific abilities (Cherappurath & Elayaraja, 2017), weight-loss clients can also benefit from the increased exercise intensity and variety of movements, as long as the client is capable of performing the exercise safely and at a high enough intensity throughout an extended workout. This can be done by creating a small circuit of appropriately challenging SAQ exercises.

### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

High-intensity interval training can burn more subcutaneous fat than long-duration, low- to moderate-intensity endurance training (Trembley et al., 1994; Viana et al., 2019).

When designing SAQ programs for weight loss, the primary focus of the program is to keep heart and respiration rates appropriately elevated to increase caloric expenditure. It is critically important to administer a thorough fitness assessment before beginning an SAQ protocol with a weight-loss client and to maintain appropriate levels of exercise intensities based on the client’s abilities and fitness level. Fitness professionals should gradually introduce SAQ training to avoid excessive impact, muscle soreness, and joint stress, with SAQ exercises included in one to two workouts per week. Technique must be mastered in each exercise used, allowing clients to perform each exercise at a comfortable speed. Gradually, the quantity of exercises can be increased as a client’s fitness improves.

### TRAINING TIP

As a weight-loss client’s fitness improves, the volume of SAQ exercises can increase. One strategy is to include SAQ exercises in two to three workouts per week, doing three to four sets of three to five repetitions, and 15 to 60 seconds of rest between repetitions. To maintain or increase a high metabolic demand, less rest is given between repetitions, but use caution to avoid improper execution of an exercise.
