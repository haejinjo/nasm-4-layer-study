**Figure 21-2: 4** illustrates the monthly plan for March. As with the previous month, this plan demonstrates a 3-day-per-week workout plan with scheduled total-body workouts on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In this month, however, Phases 1, 2, and 5 are performed in the same week. This helps introduce power training at a slower, more moderate pace with low weekly volumes while ensuring optimal levels of stabilization and strength necessary to increase power. Cardio can be done on the workout days (or any other day during the week, depending on the clientâ€™s schedule).
