## Content
The squat is a **compound (multijoint) movement pattern **due to the several joints involved (ankles, knees, and hips) and the large amount of musculature used. As a result, the squat has many benefits, such as improving muscular endurance, hypertrophy, strength, and power of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscles (Clark et al., 2012; Schoenfeld, 2010). The squat and its variations should be a staple in many exercise programs. Further, studies suggest that proper squat technique is necessary to reduce the risk of injury to the knees and back (Comfort et al., 2018; Fry et al., 2003). As such, fitness professionals must be competent and proficient in teaching the squat movement pattern to their clients (**Table 21: -4**).

**TABLE 21-4: Squat**

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Musculature | Quadriceps, gluteal complex, hamstrings, and calves |
| Primary joint actions | Ankle, knee, and hip flexion and extension |
| Daily examples | Sit to stand, getting in and out of the car, and climbing stairs |
| Exercise examples | Back squat, front squat, overhead squat, leg press, and step-ups |

Proper squatting techniques include the following:

	- Keeping the feet straight ahead and avoiding overpronation of the foot and ankle complex

	- Tracking the knees over the second and third toes; do not allow the knees to cave inward (known as knee valgus)

	- Ensuring a neutral pelvis and spine

	- Equally flexing at the ankles and hips; keep the torso and shin angles parallel, which provides equal weight distribution between the ankles, knees, and hips

	- Maintaining head and shoulders in a neutral position

#### HIP HINGE

Like the squat, the hip hinge will be used during many movements that are incorporated into activities of daily living like gardening, housework, or the simple act of putting on pants (**Table 21: -5**).

**TABLE 21-5: Hip Hinge**

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Musculature | Hamstrings, gluteal complex, low-back, and abdominals |
| Primary joint actions | Hip flexion and extension |
| Daily examples | Bending over to put on pants, reaching down and grabbing a box off the floor, cleaning, and gardening |
| Exercise examples | Romanian deadlifts, back extensions, good mornings, kettlebell swings, and Olympic weightlifting |
