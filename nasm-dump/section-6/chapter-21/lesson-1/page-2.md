# Introduction to Program Design

Creating and modifying exercise programs for clients can be a complicated process because there are many variables to consider, including the client’s goals, their tolerance for exercise, and their unique physical abilities and medical history. Moreover, fitness professionals have a multitude of different exercise formats to choose from, which can potentially cause confusion and frustration during the program design process. Keeping these concerns in mind, arguably the most important factor when creating an exercise program is to ensure it is adopted and adhered to by the client. Whether programs are developed for beginning exercisers, avid fitness enthusiasts, or experienced athletes, exercise programs need individuality and uniqueness to make them impactful and meaningful for clients. This increases commitment and helps affirm a client’s success toward reaching their health, wellness, and fitness goals.

In addition, it is vitally important for fitness professionals to design and implement exercise programs that are individualized for each client based on their needs, goals, and abilities. Exercise programs based on a client’s assessment results, attitudes, and fitness level help guarantee continued success and long-term **adherence **to the exercise program.

To assist in this process, fitness professionals must be able to answer specific questions that are related to the appropriateness of exercise programming:

	- What are my client’s needs, goals, and abilities?

	- Does my client have any concerns or contraindications for exercise due to previous injuries or medical conditions?

## Key Terms

**Adherence**
The level of commitment to a behavior or plan of action.
