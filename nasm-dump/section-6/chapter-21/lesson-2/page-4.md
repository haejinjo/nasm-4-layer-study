## Content
### WARM-UP

The first section of the exercise template is titled Warm-Up and consists of flexibility training and optional cardiorespiratory exercise. Flexibility training, like any other form of exercise, should follow a systematic progression and have a clear purpose. Flexibility techniques are used to increase joint range of motion and tissue extensibility and assist in correcting muscle imbalances. They are used as part of an integrated warm-up process to help prepare the body for physical activity and will be selected based on client assessment results, type of training, and unique requirements of the workout. Moreover, stretching techniques, like static stretching, should only be performed on tissues that have been identified as overactive during the assessment process.

The cardiorespiratory portion of a warm-up period typically lasts between 5 and 10 minutes. The purpose of the warm-up period is to increase heart and respiration rates and tissue temperature and psychologically prepare the individual for higher training intensities (McGowan et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2018).

### ACTIVATION

The next section of the OPT programming template is Activation. Activation includes core and balance exercises. This section of the template is a continuation of the client’s overall warm-up. In the preceding section, the client addressed overactive muscles by performing a variety of flexibility techniques. The next logical step is to strengthen underactive muscles identified during the assessment process, which will help reestablish ideal joint alignment, stability, and control. This can be accomplished by completing a short series of core and balance exercises.

Core training is critical for improving posture (Ko & Kang, 2017; Park et al., 2016), enhancing performance (Butcher et al., 2007; Dello Iacono et al., 2016; Shinkle et al., 2012), increasing resistance to injury (Huxel Bliven & Anderson, 2013), and accelerating injury rehabilitation (Coulombe et al., 2017).

Balance training is an important component of injury prevention programs and has been proven to help reduce the incidence of lower extremity injuries, such as ankle sprains and anterior cruciate ligament tears (Dargo et al., 2017; Nessler et al., 2017; Rivera et al., 2017). Furthermore, balance training is an effective mode of exercise for enhancing athletic performance and posture (Brachman et al., 2017). As such, core and balance training, when paired, can be an effective warm-up strategy following flexibility techniques.

#### GETTING TECHNICAL

Individuals knowledgeable and skilled in corrective exercise may substitute other forms of activation techniques in this section, such as isolated strengthening techniques. To learn more about corrective exercise, refer to NASM’s Corrective Exercise Specialist course.
