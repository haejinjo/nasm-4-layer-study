#### PHASE 3 RESISTANCE TRAINING PROTOCOL

Resistance training for Phase 3 is specific for the adaptation of muscular development; however, training in this phase has many benefits that align with common fitness goals, such as improvements in body composition. Clients seeking to obtain greater muscle mass and improvements in weight management and metabolism can benefit from this form of training. In fact, resistance training is an important protocol during a clientâ€™s weight-loss journey to preserve lean muscle mass (Cava et al., 2017). Because the goal of this phase of training is primarily hypertrophy, the fitness professional will want to increase volume and intensity of the program. Choose between three and six sets with 6 to 12 repetitions using a moderate 2-0-2-0 tempo and two to four exercises per body part. However, fitness professionals have the option of choosing a repetition scheme greater than 12, such as 12 to 20, if additional muscular endurance is desired (Schoenfeld et al., 2015, 2019).

#### PHASE 4 RESISTANCE TRAINING PROTOCOL

Resistance training for Phase 4 is specific for the adaptation of maximal strength. Clients, such as strength athletes seeking optimal strength enhancements, will benefit from this form of training as will those looking to enhance muscle hypertrophy. This is an advanced form of training and only recommended for experienced lifters and exercisers who have worked their way up to this phase of the model.

Choose between four and six sets with one to five repetitions using an explosive repetition tempo (notated as X-X-X-X) and two to four exercises per body part. However, fitness professionals have the option of choosing more than six sets for advanced clients that require additional volume. Moreover, not every client who has progressed through the first three phases of the OPT model is seeking to increase their maximal strength capabilities. As such, this is an optional phase of the OPT model.

### STRENGTH LEVEL CLIENT'S CHOICE

Identical to Phase 1, clients are allowed to choose their own exercises in this section of the workout. Any type of exercise is permitted in this section as long as it is deemed safe.

### STRENGTH LEVEL COOL-DOWN

The cool-down portion is identical in all five phases of the OPT model and should last between 5 and 10 minutes. It includes, in the following order, cardiorespiratory exercise (optional), self-myofascial techniques, and static stretching. When executing self-myofascial techniques, such as foam rolling, choose one to three muscle groups and hold on each tender area for a minimum of 30 seconds to elicit an optimal relaxation response. This will be followed by static stretching for the same muscle groups.
