## Content
Core and balance training are also important for this population because they tend to lack balance and walking speed, both of which are important for exercise. Fitness professionals must use caution when placing an obese client in a prone (on stomach) or supine (on back) position because they are susceptible to both hypotensive (low blood pressure) and hypertensive (high blood pressure) responses to exercise. Having obese clients perform exercises in a standing position may be more appropriate and more comfortable for them. For example, performing a plank exercise on an incline (**Figure 23: -1**) or a standing medicine ball rotation (**Figure 23: -2**) may be best suited for certain obese clients versus supine crunches performed on the floor. Resistance training exercises may need to be started in a seated position and progressed to a standing position.

Fitness professionals should ensure that the client is breathing correctly during resistance training exercises and avoids straining during exercise or squeezing exercise bars too tightly, which can cause an increase in blood pressure.
