**TABLE 23-7: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Individuals Who Are Overweight or Obese**

| Mode | Low-impact (such as treadmill walking, rowing, stationary cycling, and water activity) |
|---|---|
| Frequency | At least 5 days per week |
| Intensity | 60–80% of maximum heart rate

Intensities may be altered to 40–70% of maximal heart rate if needed.

Using the *talk test can be helpful to determine exercise intensity. |
| Duration | 40–60 minutes per day, or 20- to 30-minute sessions twice each day |
| Assessment | Pushing assessment

Pulling assessment

Overhead squat assessment (if tolerated) |
| Flexibility | Self-myofascial techniques (only if comfortable to client)

Static, active, and dynamic stretches |
| Resistance Training | 1–3 sets of 10–15 repetitions on 2–3 days per week

Exercises performed in a circuit-training manner, with higher repetitions, such as 20, may be used if tolerated by the individual. |
| Special Considerations | Make sure client is comfortable—be aware of positions and locations in the facility your client is in.

Exercises should be performed in a standing or seated position.

Clients may have other chronic diseases; in such cases, a medical release should be obtained from the individual’s physician. |

^**Note*: The talk test is a method of measuring intensity. If the client can comfortably carry on a conversation while exercising, they are probably at the lower ranges of training heart rate. If the client is having difficulty finishing a sentence, the intensity is probably at the high range. Depending on the individual’s response and exercise status, adjust intensity accordingly.^
