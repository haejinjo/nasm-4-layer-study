**TABLE 23-10: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Hypertension**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Blood pressure response to exercise may be variable and exaggerated, depending on the mode and level of intensity. | A program of continuous, lower-intensity (50–85% of work capacity) aerobic exercise is initially recommended.

Frequency and duration parameters should be at a minimum 3–5 days per week, 20–45 minutes per day, with additional increases in overall volume of exercise if weight loss is also desired. |
| Despite medication, clients may arrive with pre-exercise hypertension. | Resistance exercise should consist of a peripheral heart action or circuit-training style.

Avoid Valsalva maneuvers (holding breath), emphasize rhythmic breathing and a program design for muscular fitness (e.g., 1–3 sets of 8–10 exercises, 10–20 reps, 2–3 days per week). |
| Hypertension frequently is associated with other comorbidities, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. | Screening for comorbidities is important.

Exercise should target a weekly caloric goal of 1,500–2,000 kcal, progressing as tolerable, to maximize weight loss and cardio protection. |
| Some medications for hypertension, such as beta-blockers, will decrease the heart rate at rest and its response to exercise. | For clients taking medications that will influence heart rate, do not use predicted maximal heart rate formulas.

Use actual heart rate response or the talk test.

Accepted blood pressure contraindications for exercise include an SBP of 200 mm Hg and a DBP of 115 mm Hg. Always check with any other guidelines the fitness facility may have in place (Riebe et al., 2018). |

^*Note*: SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure.^

**TABLE 23-11: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Individuals with Hypertension**

| Mode | Stationary cycling, treadmill walking, rowers |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 3–7 days per week |
| Intensity | 50–85% of maximal heart rate

Cardiorespiratory training can start as low as 40% of HRmax, if needed, and be progressed as tolerated. |
| Duration | 30–60 minutes |
| Assessment | Pushing assessment

Pulling assessment

Overhead squat assessment

Single-leg squat assessment (if tolerated) |
| Flexibility | Static and active in a standing or seated position |
| Resistance Training | 1–3 sets of 10–20 repetitions, 2–3 days per week

Tempo should not exceed 1 second for isometric and concentric portions of the lift.

Use circuit or peripheral heart action system (PHA) weight training as an option, with appropriate rest intervals. |
| Special Considerations | Avoid heavy lifting and Valsalva maneuvers—make sure client breathes normally.

Do not let client overgrip weights or clench fists when training.

Modify tempo to avoid extended isometric and concentric muscle actions.

Perform exercises in a standing or seated position.

Allow client to stand up slowly to avoid possible dizziness.

Progress client slowly. |
