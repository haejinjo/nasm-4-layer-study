# Coronary Heart Disease

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death and disability for both men and women despite a significant reduction in death rates from CHD in recent years (Mensah et al., 2017). CHD is caused by atherosclerosis (plaque formation), which leads to narrowing of the coronary arteries and ultimately angina pectoris (chest pain), myocardial infarction (heart attack), or both (Triposkiadis et al., 2007). The primary cause of CHD is poor lifestyle choices—primarily cigarette smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity (Esselstyn, 2017). From a medical standpoint, the emphasis on treating CHD is centered on improving the health of the internal lining of the coronary artery, called plaque stabilization. The other primary focus on the treatment of CHD is through medical management, including pharmaceuticals, as well as aggressive lifestyle intervention, including healthier food choices, more exercise, smoking cessation, and stress reduction.Increasing numbers of individuals with diagnosed, and undiagnosed, heart disease are seeking the advice of fitness professionals on appropriate exercise training. The risk of serious cardiovascular complications, even death, is low in exercise programs that include clients with CHD. The risk of exercise for clients with CHD is likely low because they should be well screened and monitored by their physician and fitness staff. Nonetheless, fitness professionals must be aware of the presence of clients with heart disease and help design effective exercise programs with the knowledge that exercise can pose a risk for clients with heart disease **(Table 23-12).**

**TABLE 23-12: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Coronary Heart Disease**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| The nature of heart disease may result in a specific level of exercise that would be dangerous to go beyond. | The safe upper limit of exercise, preferably by heart rate, must be obtained.

Heart rate should never be estimated from existing prediction formulas for clients with heart disease; consult their physician. |
| Clients with heart disease may not have angina or other warning signs. | Clients must be able to monitor pulse rate or use an accurate monitor to stay below the safe upper limit of exercise. |
| Between underlying disease and medication use, the heart rate response to exercise will nearly always vary considerably from age-predicted formulas and will almost always be lower. | Although symptoms should always supersede anything else as a sign to decrease or stop exercising, some clients may not have this warning system, so monitoring heart rate becomes increasingly important. |
| Clients may have other comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, or obesity. | Screening for comorbidities is important so that modifications to exercise may be made based on these diagnoses. |
| Peak oxygen uptake (as well as ventilatory threshold) is often reduced because of the compromised cardiac pump and peripheral muscle deconditioning. | The exercise program should be low intensity, to start, and based on recommendations provided by a certified exercise physiologist or physical therapist with specialty training.

Aerobic training guidelines should follow, at minimum, 20–30 minutes 3–5 days per week at 40–85% of maximal capacity but below the safe upper limits prescribed by the physician.

A weekly caloric goal of 1,500–2,000 kcal is usually recommended, progressing as tolerable, to maximize cardio protection.

Resistance training may be started after the patient has been exercising asymptomatically and comfortably for more than 3 months in the aerobic exercise program.

A circuit-training format is recommended: 8–10 exercises, 1–3 sets of 10–20 reps per exercise, emphasizing breathing control and rest as needed between sets. |
