# Exercise and Pregnancy

The physiologic differences during exercise between men and women have been well documented. The majority of observed disparities in athletic performance between men and women are explained by differences in body structure, muscle mass, lean to fat body mass ratio, and, to a lesser extent, blood chemistry. When measures are adjusted for body composition, both physiologic and performance parameters narrow considerably or completely vanish. However, special care must be taken if a woman is pregnant (**Table 23-2: 1**).

**TABLE 23-21: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Women and Pregnancy**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Contraindications include (but are not limited to) persistent bleeding during second to third trimester, medical documentation of pregnancy-induced hypertension, or preterm labor during current or prior pregnancy. | Screen carefully for potential contraindications to exercise. |
| Decreased oxygen available for aerobic exercise. | Low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (40–50% of peak work capacity) should be performed 3–5 days per week, emphasizing nonweight-bearing exercise (e.g., swimming, cycling), although certain treadmill or elliptical training modes may be preferred and are appropriate. |
| Posture can affect blood flow to uterus during vigorous exercise. | Avoid prone and supine exercise, particularly after the first trimester.

An alternate position is lying on the back with the head and trunk raised to between 15 and 45 degrees. |
| Even in the absence of exercise, pregnancy may increase metabolic demand by 300 kcal per day to maintain energy balance. | Advise adequate caloric intake to offset exercise effect. |
| High-risk pregnancy considerations include individuals older than the age of 35 years, history of miscarriage, diabetes, thyroid disorder, anemia, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. | There are no published guidelines for resistance, flexibility, or balance training specific to pregnancy exercise.

Provided exercise intensity is below the aerobic prescription of 40–50% of peak work capacity, with careful attention to special considerations and contraindications described; adding these components may be helpful.

For resistance training, if cleared by the physician, a circuit-training format is recommended, 1–3 sets of 12–15 reps per exercise, emphasizing breathing control and rest, as needed, between sets.

Advise to wear clothing that will dissipate heat easily during exercise.

Postpartum exercise should be similar to pregnancy guidelines, as physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy may persist for up to 6 weeks. |
