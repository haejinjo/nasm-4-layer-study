## Content
Additional guidelines for further safety and proper form include using a good quality chalk to protect the hands, having plenty of space available with rubber flooring or using an outdoor area, and excluding the use of gloves.

Kettlebells can be effectively integrated into all phases of the OPT model. For example, the renegade row is a kettlebell exercise that can be used in Phase 1 to improve stability and back strength (**Figure 22-1: 5**). In Phase 2, a client can superset a seated cable row with a renegade row (**Figure 22-1: 6**). In Phase 5, a client may superset a squat to overhead press with a kettlebell snatch (**Figure 22-1: 7**).
