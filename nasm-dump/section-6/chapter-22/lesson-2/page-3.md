In addition to its versatility, one of the greatest advantages of elastic resistance over free weights is its low cost and portability. Elastic resistance bands are lightweight and can be taken anywhere. For example, traveling business people, vacationers, and in-home personal trainers can all benefit from the rewards elastic resistance offers.

Elastic resistance can be used in a variety of fashions, by virtually all populations, and effectively in all phases of the OPT model. However, as stated earlier, elastic resistance may not be the ideal modality when performing resistance training exercises for individuals seeking hypertrophy or maximal strength because high intensities (heavy loads) are required to overload the musculoskeletal system. In Phase 5 of the OPT model, elastic tubing can provide resistance during power exercises requiring explosive movement, such as a tubing speed squat (**Figure 22: -8**).

#### CRITICAL

Because elastic bands can break, potentially causing injury to both the fitness professional or their client, it is imperative to check all bands prior to each workout to ensure there are no cracks, tears, or excessive wear areas on the bands. Never use a questionable band regardless of the exercise.

### TRX RIP TRAINER

The TRX^Â®^ Rip Trainer is another form of resistance band training but uses a lever bar that is attached to one end of a nylon-covered resistance band (**Figure 22: -9**). Like elastic bands, the TRX Rip Trainer has various resistance levels. Lighter cords equate to less resistance, whereas heavier cords offer greater resistance. The ability to modify band resistance while training with the TRX Rip Trainer makes it a versatile tool for both novice and experienced fitness enthusiasts or athletes.
