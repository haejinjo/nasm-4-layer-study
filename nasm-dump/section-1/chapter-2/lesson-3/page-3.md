### GUIDELINES FOR UNCOMPROMISING CUSTOMER SERVICE

A major focus of daily operations in the fitness world is customer service. It is important to remember that customers return because they feel valued—like they are a part of something special. There are many reasons why individuals join a health club, such as improving health and overall well-being, managing a healthy body weight, providing activities for the family, or simply feeling more comfortable in their own skin. However, there are only two primary reasons why members and clients continue to return:

	- They have learned how to enjoy exercise and are experiencing the results they want.

	- The service they receive is highly enjoyable, and the facility provides a sense of community.

The fitness industry is part of the service industry. When an individual invests in a health club membership, they are paying for access to the facility and the services provided by the employees. If a Certified Personal Trainer fails to deliver a high level of service to clients, then attracting and retaining clients becomes very challenging. It is important to note that clients have many different demands for their time. This means the most successful Certified Personal Trainers are the ones who can adapt accordingly to each individual’s communication preferences and coaching needs. A client could hire a Certified Personal Trainer for many reasons, but the services that clients are actually paying for and expect include the following:

	- **Accountability**. Many clients want to be held accountable for their exercise goals and prefer to be contacted, especially after missing a session. Fitness professionals should allow no more than 24 hours to pass before contacting a client after a missed session. This demonstrates a level of service that can help ensure the client adheres to the program.

	- **Support**. Wearing exercise clothes or exercising in a public area can be intimidating for many people and hiring a Certified Personal Trainer can help certain individuals build confidence to exercise. Fitness professionals should always seek to create a positive environment where clients feel proper support and encouragement for pursuing their exercise goals.

	- **Feedback and guidance**. One of the most important benefits of working with a fitness professional is receiving the proper instruction for the exercises required to reach specific goals as well as the guidance for how to follow and make progress in a long-term exercise program.

	- **Results**. Clients want to know that their exercise program is producing the desired outcome. The most effective way to evaluate progress is by conducting various fitness assessments. Fitness assessments allow a fitness professional to have a specific, methodical, and consistent way to gather data about a client’s progress every few weeks.

Existing and potential clients will always expect those minimum levels of service. If they are not met, then it is likely that clients will take their business elsewhere or, in certain cases, quit exercising altogether. If the expectations are exceeded, however, clients are more likely to return and may also refer their friends or loved ones. When it comes to long-term clientele development, even the best marketing and sales techniques are never as powerful as direct client referrals. Client referrals are a powerful strategy to gain more clients and keep a steady stream of business.
