## Certified Fitness Professionals

Fitness professionals include Certified Personal Trainers, group fitness instructors, and strength and conditioning coaches. A Certified Personal Trainer is an individual with specific knowledge of fitness and exercise science who has passed a credentialling exam offered by a national certifying organization. They screen clients to ensure safety and make recommendations for exercise programming and other lifestyle changes. Also, Certified Personal Trainers help motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback and accountability and recommendations for progression or alternate workouts.

A group fitness instructor is a fitness professional who teaches, leads, and motivates individuals through large-group exercise classes. They have various levels of knowledge, training, and education necessary to provide safe instruction across various class formats and settings.

Group fitness instructors typically hold a certification in group exercise or a more specific area of expertise (e.g., indoor cycling, aerobic dance, Pilates, or yoga). A group fitness instructor’s scope of practice is traditionally limited to apparently healthy individuals, because clients rarely, if ever, take part in fitness assessments prior to attending a group class.

A strength and conditioning coach is a fitness professional with advanced knowledge, training, and experience in designing and implementing strength and conditioning programs for competitive athletes. The majority of strength and conditioning coaches hold an undergraduate degree in a field related to exercise science, one or more national certifications, and considerable hands-on experience working with athletes. They can work with athletes of all ages and abilities, from youth to elite professional athletes.

### ROLE OF THE CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER

While entry-level Certified Personal Trainers are fitness professionals who work with apparently healthy clients, additional training, education, and experience enable many to become qualified to work with a wider range of clients, including those with chronic diseases who have been medically cleared to exercise. Certified Personal Trainers generally work one-on-one with clients or in small groups and objectively measure clients’ strengths and weaknesses with a variety of fitness, posture, and body composition assessments. From those assessments, they go on to design safe and effective exercise programs to help their clients reach their health, wellness, or fitness goals.
