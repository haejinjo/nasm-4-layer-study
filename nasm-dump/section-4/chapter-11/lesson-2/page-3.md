## Pre-assessment Instructions

Prior to conducting any assessment, measures should be taken to ensure individual safety and comfort. In advance, the fitness professional should provide precise and clearly defined instructions regarding preparation for testing. Clients should wear comfortable, athletic clothing and ingest plenty of fluids over the 24-hour period preceding the test to optimize hydration levels. Clients should also avoid heavy food, tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine at least 3 hours prior to testing, avoid exercise or strenuous activity the day before or the day of the test, and get adequate amounts of sleep the night before the test.

### TRAINING TIP

**Explaining and Demonstrating Assessments**

Adopt a philosophy of briefly explaining the purpose of the test, the protocol, and expectations. However, keep your explanations short and simple and use appropriate easy-to-understand language. Because many individuals are visual learners, include demonstrations whenever possible (the explanation and demonstration can occur simultaneously). When appropriate, allow for some practice trials to facilitate learning and mastery of the physical tasks required.
