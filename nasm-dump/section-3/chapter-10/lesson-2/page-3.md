**TABLE 10-1 Recommended Daily Values (DV) and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of Micronutrients (continued)**

|  |  | Adults | Pregnant and Lactating Women |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nutrient | Unit of Measure | DV | UL | DV | UL |
| Vitamin B12 | mcg | 2.4 | n/a | 2.8 | n/a |
| Biotin | mcg | 30 | n/a | 35 | n/a |
| Pantothenic acid | mg | 5 | n/a | 7 | n/a |
| Phosphorusa | mg | 1,250 | 4,000 | 1,250 | 4,000 |
| Iodine | mcg | 150 | 1,100 | 290 | 1,100 |
| Magnesiumd | mg | 420 | 350a | 400 | 350a |
| Zinc | mg | 11 | 40 | 13 | 40 |
| Selenium | mcg | 55 | 400 | 70 | 400 |
| Copper | mg | 0.9 | 10 | 1.3 | 10 |
| Manganese | mg | 2.3 | 11 | 2.6 | 11 |
| Chromium | mcg | 35 | n/a | 45 | n/a |
| Molybdenum | mcg | 45 | 2,000 | 50 | 2,000 |
| Chloride | mg | 2,300 | 3,600 | 2,300 | 3,600 |
| Choline | mg | 550 | 3,500 | 550 | 3,500 |

~*Note*: The ULs are those suggested by the National Academy of Medicine; n/a indicates that a UL has not been set, either by decision or lack of information.~

~^a^The UL for calcium is reduced to 2,000 mg per day for individuals older than 50 years, and the UL for phosphorus is reduced to 3,000 mg for individuals older than 70 years.~

~^b^Vitamin A is dosed in micrograms of retinol activity equivalents (RAE): 1 mcg RAE = 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg supplemental β-carotene, 12 mcg dietary β-carotene, or 24 mcg dietary α-carotene, or dietary 24 mcg dietary β-cryptoxanthin.~

~^c^Folate is dosed in micrograms of dietary folate equivalents (DFE). 1 DFE = 1 mcg naturally occurring folate = 0.6 mcg folic acid.~

~^d^The UL for magnesium applies to supplemental magnesium only, not magnesium obtained in the diet (Institute of Medicine, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2011).~

**DV Versus DRI**

When referring to supplementation values, fitness professionals will often see acronyms DV and DRI used interchangeably. Dietary reference intake (DRI) values provide consumers with information, such as adequate intake and upper intake levels of a given micronutrient. Daily value (DV) is the FDA’s intake recommendation of a given micronutrient and is similar to the National Academy of Medicine’s use of recommended dietary allowances (RDA).
