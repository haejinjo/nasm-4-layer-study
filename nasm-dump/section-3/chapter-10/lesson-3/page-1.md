# Health Supplements

Dietary supplements can be classified into two broad categories: **health supplements** and **performance supplements**. Although performance seems to receive more attention, health supplements represent a much larger market. Among all supplement users, at least 70% are using a multivitamin, citing overall health and wellness as their reason for doing so, and this number increases to 83% for the 18- to 34-year-old age group (Council for Responsible Nutrition, 2018). Health supplements primarily include vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 supplements, because their main function is to improve well-being. In many cases, fitness clients are not competitive athletes looking to improve performance, but rather individuals looking to improve their body composition and quality of life. Therefore, the fitness professional can expect to receive questions about and be asked for their input on health supplements. In other cases, assessment of a client may suggest nutrient insufficiencies, and it may be appropriate to recommend clients seek their physiciansâ€™ opinion on adding a health supplement.

## Vitamin and Mineral Supplements

Most of the dietary supplements currently sold are multivitamins, which contain a variety of **vitamins** and **minerals**. Individual vitamins and minerals are available as well for those who have identified specific needs. This category of dietary supplements is often used to ensure adequate vitamin and mineral intake, as micronutrient intake is typically inadequate with Western diets as well as more restrictive diets. Often overlooked, vitamins are available in both **biologically active** and **inactive** forms. In some cases, the inactive form may be converted to the active form. This is important because inactive forms are less efficient for augmenting body levels and achieving desired outcomes.

### FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS

The fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K (**Figure 10-4**). These vitamins are stored in fat tissue instead of water, like water-soluble vitamins. Because of their solubility, they are best taken with a fat-containing meal (Dawson-Hughes et al., 2015). For this reason, fat-soluble vitamins also pose a greater risk for toxicity.

Vitamin A is also commonly supplemented as **beta-carotene**, and as a fat-soluble vitamin, toxicity is a potential result of excessive supplementation.

## Key Terms

**Vitamins**

**Biologically active**
The form in which a vitamin must be to exert an effect within the body.

**Biologically inactive**
Any form of vitamin that cannot exert its effect within the body.
