The fitness professional can and should anticipate questions about dietary supplements, particularly from clients asking if they should start taking any dietary supplements for their goals or if the supplement that they may already be taking is beneficial. For these reasons and more, the Certified Personal Trainer is expected to have at least a basic understanding of dietary supplements, including common forms of caffeine, creatine, and protein supplementation and proper use. Clients may be interested in using these supplements and others for improving their own health, body composition, and/or performance attributes. It is probable that clients will ask their Certified Personal Trainer for recommendations on supplements for each of these common goals, what supplements the Certified Personal Trainer takes, and if they should do the same. Be prepared to explain to them that dietary supplements are to be used to supplement their diet to help meet daily requirements and potentially support their training routines and desired outcomes. Some employers will ask the Certified Personal Trainer to sell supplements as a part of their job description. It is important for fitness professionals to be made aware of this requirement prior to employment.</p>
