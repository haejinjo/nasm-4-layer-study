### CHAPTER REVIEW

The fitness professional must know how to interpret a dietary supplement label and to recognize potential trouble spots, such as improper labeling, misleading claims, and possibly proprietary blends. The safest and smartest choices for dietary supplements are those with third-party verification and scientific evidence demonstrating safety and effectiveness. It is also prudent to identify the effective dosage of common dietary supplements, such as protein, creatine, and caffeine, to readily identify dietary supplements with adequate dosages. The fitness professional need not remember exact daily values or tolerable upper limits but should be wary of DVs listed in multiples of 100, as these may exceed the UL. It is beyond the scope of the Certified Personal Trainer to prescribe supplements, particularly to treat a medical condition or disease, but the Certified Personal Trainer may educate clients to dispel common myths and fallacies regarding supplement use.

#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

	- Dietary supplements are products (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: vitamin; mineral; herb or other botanical; amino acid; substance used by man to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake; or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any previously described ingredient.

	- In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA according to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. However, supplements do not require review or approval prior to being marketed and sold.

	- The fitness professional should understand the required components of the dietary supplement label, including the active ingredients, other ingredients, pertinent warnings, total contents, usage instructions, and serving size.

	- Dietary supplements may be used for health and/or performance goals.

	- Dietary supplements used specifically for performance are classified as ergogenic aids.

	- Vitamin and mineral supplements may be used by individuals to correct or supply insufficient dietary intake in an effort to consume the DV each day.

	- Vitamin and mineral intake should not exceed the UL unless by the direction of a dietitian or physician.

	- Dietary supplements and other ergogenic aids may produce adverse effects or serious adverse effects. Such effects may arise from the dietary supplements themselves or from a change to or the contamination of the products.

	- Protein supplements are convenient methods to increase total daily protein intake, the most important consideration for protein intake. Protein needs depend on the activity level, body size, and body composition goal of the individual.

	- An effective dose of creatine is at least 0.03 g per kg body weight, but a typical dose at 5 g per day ensures complete muscle saturation.

	- An effective dose of caffeine is 3 to 6 mg/kg (1.4–2.7 mg/lb) per day.

	- Banned substances may not always be illegal substances, and athletes must check with their governing body (such as the NCAA or WADA) prior to consuming a dietary supplement. It is also wise for athletes to choose a supplement with third-party verification from Informed Choice or NSF.

	- It is beyond the scope of practice for a fitness professional to prescribe dietary supplements to clients to treat a medical condition or disease. It is appropriate for the fitness professional to provide general education about supplements or to direct a client to consult with a dietitian or medical professional.
