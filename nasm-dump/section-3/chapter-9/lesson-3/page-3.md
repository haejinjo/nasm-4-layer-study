**TABLE 9-10 Soluble and Insoluble Fiber**

| Fiber Type | Definition | Good Food Sources | Health Benefits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soluble fiber | A type of dietary fiber that dissolves in water to form a gel; associated with heart health benefits and glucose control | Oats
	 Barley
	Legumes
	Most fruits (especially pears, berries)
	Most vegetables
	Psyllium seeds | Delays gastric emptying; may prolong satiety (feeling of fullness)
	Helps to lower cholesterol
	Associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease
	Promotes health of the gastrointestinal tract by promoting healthy gut flora |
| Insoluble fiber | A type of dietary fiber that does not dissolve in water; associated with promoting bowel regularity | Whole bran cereals, whole grains
	Lentils, legumes
	 Nuts
	Potatoes
	Most fruit and vegetables (especially the outer skin) | Adds bulk; may help promote satiety
	Improves bowel regularity and helps prevent constipation |

## Carbohydrate Digestion, Absorption, and Utilization

To be used for energy, carbohydrates must be broken down into smaller units and absorbed by the body. This process takes place in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the small intestine. Simple sugars are easily digested and absorbed through the intestinal lining, because they are small units of single or double sugars. Starch, however, is comprised of long polysaccharide chains that must first be broken down into smaller units by enzymes for absorption. For example, when an individual consumes a source of starch, such as grains, potatoes, or bread, the starch is physically broken into smaller pieces in the mouth and stomach and then broken down into monosaccharides and disaccharides by enzymes in the small intestine. These small units travel to the liver, which converts most fructose and galactose to glucose, and then directs glucose to other tissues and organs to be taken up by cells and used for energy. Some glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and skeletal muscle to meet future energy requirements (**Figure 9-4**). Any excess carbohydrate is converted to fat and stored in the liver, muscle, and **adipose tissue **for future energy needs.

## Glucose and Blood Sugar

Once carbohydrates are consumed, there is a corresponding rise in blood sugar levels as glucose enters the bloodstream. Simple carbohydrates consumed on their own, such as simple sugars found in juices, sports drinks, and candy, are absorbed more rapidly than complex carbohydrates and, therefore, lead to a rapid rise in glucose levels. **Complex carbohydrates** (starches in whole grains, starchy vegetables, legumes, and vegetables) are digested more slowly and are associated with a slower rise in glucose levels. A slower rate of glucose entry and a slower rise in glucose levels can provide a more sustained source of energy compared to a rapid increase.

## Key Terms

**Adipose tissue**
An alternative term for fat, used primarily to store energy.

**Complex carbohydrates**
Polysaccharides; long chains of simple sugars. Examples include whole grains, legumes, and vegetables.
