## Content
Fitness professionals working with clients who have sports performance goals can help them optimize their training by reinforcing the importance of adequate nutrition, hydration, and recovery. These factors are both complementary to and crucial for enhancing the benefits of training; adequate or inadequate nutrition, hydration, or sleep can greatly affect an individualâ€™s sports performance. As outlined earlier, if clients request specific nutrition prescriptions for nutrient intake, they should be referred to a qualified nutrition professional for further guidance.
