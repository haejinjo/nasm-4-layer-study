## Content
However, in cases where a client has medical issues that require specific dietary modifications, or if a client requests specific meal plans, a fitness professional should refer the client to a qualified nutrition professional, such as an RD or LD, for further guidance. This not only respects the scope of practice for both professions but also ensures that clients benefit from the expertise provided by qualified professionals in their own areas of practice. **Table 9-2 **provides some examples of nutrition topics that fitness professionals can and cannot discuss with clients.

## Accessing Credible Nutrition Information

Nutrition information, education, and advice appears abundantly on the internet and various social media platforms. However, it is important to distinguish and differentiate between false or misleading **nutrition claims **and credible, valid nutrition information. Examples of some misleading nutrition claims that have surfaced on various social media platforms include drinking celery juice to cure all types of ailments, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and drinking hot lemon water in the morning to detoxify the body.

Credible nutrition information is rooted in and supported by empirical science. It is information that is presented after careful, thorough research that has been reviewed by qualified and credentialed professionals in the field. Individual testimonials or nutritional recommendations based on personal experience and success with a dietary protocol does not qualify as credible nutrition information that may be immediately extrapolated or applied to other individuals, because there are many variables and individual differences that must be accounted for.

## Key Terms

**Nutrition claim**
Claim that a food has a specific nutritional property or provides a specific benefit.
