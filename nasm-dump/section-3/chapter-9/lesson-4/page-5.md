## Content
Lipids, such as olives, olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish, provide important health benefits in a balanced diet. These should not be feared as additions to provide flavor and fullness in a meal, which is a great strategy to use when encouraging an overall healthy eating pattern.

**Cholesterol: LDL Versus HDL**

Cholesterol is a type of lipid found in animal foods and in our body. There are different types of cholesterol, but the two most common types are LDL and HDL. LDL cholesterol refers to low-density lipoprotein and is considered to be less heart-healthy than HDL. HDL cholesterol refers to high-density lipoproteins, which are mostly comprised of protein and some triglycerides. They are typically considered to be heart-healthy, because they remove triglycerides from tissues and blood and transport them back to the liver for disposal.

# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Cholesterol is not essential, since it is produced by the body, but it is an important part of cell membrane structure and required for the synthesis of bile, vitamin D, and the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. Many animal foods (egg yolks, shellfish, meat, and poultry) contain some cholesterol, and these may be included as part of a healthy diet. Although egg yolks and shellfish are high in cholesterol, research has shown that for most healthy individuals, dietary cholesterol in foods has very little effect on serum (blood) cholesterol (Fernandez, 2012; Nakamura et al., 2007).

Clients who express a fear of eating egg yolks and shellfish because of their cholesterol content may be reassured that these foods are very nutritious and that their intake is unlikely to affect blood cholesterol levels. They should be referred to a medical professional, RD, or licensed nutritionist for further assistance on any medical and dietary concerns related to their blood cholesterol levels.
