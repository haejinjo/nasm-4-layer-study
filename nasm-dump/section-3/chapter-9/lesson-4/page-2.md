Each of the fatty acid chains in a triglyceride molecule may be saturated or unsaturated. A saturated fatty acid has no double bonds (points of unsaturation), although an unsaturated fatty acid may have one or more double bonds at any point in the chain. If a single fatty acid chain in a triglyceride molecule has a point of unsaturation (double bond), the fat is classified as an **unsaturated fat**. Unsaturated fats are further categorized depending on their degree of unsaturation. If an unsaturated fat has only a single point of unsaturation (double bond), it is classified as a monounsaturated fat. If there are two or more double bonds along a fatty acid chain, it is called a polyunsaturated fat.

## Key Terms

**Unsaturated fats**
Fatty acids with one or more points of unsaturation (double bond) in their chemical structure.
