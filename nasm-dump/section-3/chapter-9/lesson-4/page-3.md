**Saturated fats** were previously considered to be “artery-clogging” fats and harmful for heart health; however, recent research has shown that moderate amounts of saturated fat intake may not carry a substantial risk (Siri-Tarino et al., 2010). Currently, the cumulative evidence indicates that the overall composition and quality of an individual’s diet as well as genetic influences, rather than a single nutrient, play the most significant roles in determining the risk of cardiovascular risk and mortality. Rather than vilifying saturated fats as the culprit for heart disease, a better approach may be to consume them in moderation within the context of an overall healthy diet. Rather than focusing on a single nutrient, fitness professionals may wish to reinforce the importance of an overall balanced and healthy diet to clients.

**Table 9-14** lists the different types of saturated and unsaturated fats, including their perceived roles, potential health benefits, and primary food sources.

**TABLE 9-14 Monounsaturated, Omega-3, Omega-6, Saturated, and Trans Fats**

| Type of Fat | Role/Health Benefit | Food Sources |
|---|---|---|
| Monounsaturated fats | Heart healthy
	Notably high in the Mediterranean diet | Olives, olive oil
	Canola oil
	Avocado
	Peanuts |
| Polyunsaturated fats: omega-3

	Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
	Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
	Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) | Heart healthy
	Lower triglycerides
	Associated with improvements in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels
	Reduced inflammation
	Associated with improved cognitive function
	Associated with a reduced risk of dementia | Fatty fish (EPA and DHA): salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel
	Walnuts, flaxseed, chia seeds (ALA)
	Fortified milk, fortified eggs (DHA)
	Dairy from grass-fed cows (DHA, ALA)
	Green vegetables (ALA) |
| Polyunsaturated fats: omega-6 | Essential for normal growth and development | Vegetable oils, nuts, seeds |
| Saturated fats | Exact health benefits remain unclear
	General recommendations advise limiting excess saturated fats in the diet | Animal fats, full-fat dairy, coconut oil, palm oil |
| Trans fats | Artificial/added trans fats increase LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. They are also associated with increased inflammation and heart disease (Harvard Medical School, 2015)
	Naturally occurring trans fats are less harmful than artificial trans fat | Artificial/added trans fats are in partially hydrogenated oils and processed foods that contain these oils
	Naturally occurring trans fats are found in animal fats and dairy |

## Key Terms

**Saturated fat**
A type of triglyceride; chemical structure has no double bonds (points of unsaturation); usually solid at room temperature. Examples: butter, lard, whole milk, beef, processed meats, and tropical oils.
