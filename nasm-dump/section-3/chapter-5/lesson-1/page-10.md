## Content
## Nervous System Life Course

The nervous system develops continuously from birth through older adulthood. Through a child’s development, the body goes through a set of developmental milestones that include physical (e.g., taking first steps), mental (e.g., problem solving), social and emotional (e.g., manages emotions), and communication (e.g., speaking first words). These milestones are often used as checkpoints by healthcare professionals to determine how a child is developing (Scharf et al., 2016).

The adolescent brain continues to develop from 10 to 25 years of age. Adolescent maturation of the CNS may be influenced by several factors, such as heredity, environment, prenatal and postnatal injury, nutritional status, sleep patterns, medications, and surgical interventions during early childhood (Arain et al., 2013).

Over the course of the entire human life span, the CNS continues to develop through **neuroplasticity** (i.e., neuronal changes) and changes in **neurocircuitry **(i.e., neuronal connections), which occur with the acquisition of new skills. For example, when an adolescent child is taught how to kick a ball, their brain will stimulate specific neuronal changes and connections that allow the child to understand and replicate the newly acquired skill. This concept is highly important for fitness professionals, because it mirrors what is happening in the brain when a client becomes more skilled at an exercise and is ready to progress to more difficult challenges in the gym.

While humans can always learn new things at any stage of life, as the body gets older there is both a physical and cognitive decline. Several classic research studies have documented that neurotransmitter levels (e.g., dopamine and serotonin) decline about 10% after early adulthood; the physical weight of the brain declines 5% per decade after age 40 years; and neurocognitive issues (e.g., Alzheimer disease) are most prevalent in adults 65 years or older (Damoiseaux, 2017; Peters, 2006; Wyss-Coray, 2016). Luckily, one of the best ways to help counter the cognitive decline associated with aging is to stay physically fit (Macpherson et al., 2017).

## Key Terms

**Neuroplasticity**
The concept that the brain will continually change or grow, reforming neural pathways throughout an individual’s entire life span.

**Neurocircuitry**
The interconnection of neurons in the brain and spinal cord.
