## Content
The hinge joint is a uniaxial joint allowing movement predominantly in one direction. Joints such as the elbow, interphalangeal (toe), and ankle are considered hinge joints (**Figure 5-29**) (Floyd, 2018).

The saddle joint is named after its appearance. One bone looks like a saddle with the articulating bone straddling it like a rider. This joint is only found in the carpometacarpal joint in the thumb. Due to the shape, movement is predominantly in two directions (**Figure 5-30**) (Floyd, 2018; Hamill et al., 2015).

Pivot joints allow movement in predominantly one direction. These joints are found in the atlantoaxial joint at the base of the skull (top of spine) and the proximal radioulnar joint at the elbow (**Figure 5-31**) (Floyd, 2018).

Ball-and-socket joints are the most mobile of the joints. They allow movement in all three directions. Examples of these joints are the shoulder and hip (**Figure 5-32**) (Floyd, 2018).
