## Content
## Joints

Joints are formed when one bone articulates (joins) with another bone. Joints can be categorized by their shape, structure, and function (Hamill et al., 2015). There are two ways to describe the movement of skeletal components. **Osteokinematics** is the description of bone movement (e.g., flexion and extension), while **arthrokinematics **is the description of joint movement (i.e., the interaction between two bone surfaces) (Lee et al., 2017; Neumann, 2012). The three major types of arthrokinematics include roll, slide or glide, and spin (Neumann, 2012). It is important to note that motions rarely occur, if ever, as an isolated fashion. As is the case with the human body, variations and combinations of multiple arthrokinematics take place during various movement patterns.

In a rolling joint movement, one joint rolls across the surface of another much like the tire of a bicycle rolls on the street. An example of roll in the body is the femoral condyles (lowest ends of the thigh bone) rolling over the tibial condyles (upper ends of the shin bone) during a squat (**Figure 5-24**).

In a sliding movement, one joint’s surface slides across another much like the tire of a bicycle skidding across the street. An example of slide in the human body is the tibial condyles sliding across the femoral condyles during a knee extension or squat (**Figure 5-25**).

In a spinning movement, one joint surface rotates on another much like twisting the lid off a jar (**Figure 5-26**). An example of a spin movement in the human body is the head of the radius (a bone of the forearm) rotating on the end of the humerus (upper arm bone) during pronation and supination of the forearm.
