## Content
#### PROCESSES

**Processes** are projections protruding from the bone to which tendons and ligaments can attach. Some of the more common processes are process, condyle, epicondyle, tubercle, and trochanter (Bandovic & Futterman, 2019). Examples of processes include the spinous processes found on the vertebrae (**Figure 5-17**).

Condyles are located on the inner and outer portions at the bottom of the femur (thigh bone) and top of the tibia (shin bone) to form the knee joint (**Figure 5-18**) (Bandovic &  Futterman, 2019).

Epicondyles are located on the inner and outer portions of the humerus to help form the elbow joint (**Figure 5-19**) (Floyd, 2018).

The tubercles are located at the top of the humerus at the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint—the greater and lesser tubercles, which are attachment sites for shoulder musculature (**Figure 5-20**).

Finally, the trochanters are located at the top of the femur (thigh bone) and are attachment sites for the hip musculature (**Figure 5-21**) (Bandovic & Futterman, 2019).

## Key Terms
