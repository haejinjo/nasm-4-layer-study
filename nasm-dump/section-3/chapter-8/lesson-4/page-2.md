### RESTING METABOLIC RATE

The RMR is the number of calories that the body uses at complete rest to function (e.g., pumping blood, breathing, fueling the brain, organ functioning). Simply put, RMR is the minimum energy expenditure (i.e., number of calories needed) to keep a person alive. This number can vary considerably among individuals, but people with more muscle mass tend to have a higher RMR because muscle is a more active user of ATP than other bodily tissues. RMR accounts for around 70% of TDEE, with activity (EAT + NEAT) and TEF making up the remainder of the daily energy expenditure (Trexler et al., 2014) (**Figure 8-12**).

#### GETTING TECHNICAL

One of the best methods to measure RMR is via indirect calorimetry, a process that uses expired gasses (CO~2~) to predict energy expenditure. However, the equipment to do this is not widely available, so there are several equations that can be used to estimate RMR, including the Harris-Benedict, Miflin St. Jeor, and Katch-McArdle methods. There are also many online calculators that have been developed that incorporate one or more prediction equations in an attempt to improve the accuracy.

However, when compared to measuring RMR through indirect calorimetry, all prediction equations tend to underestimate RMR, especially for muscular people and clinical populations (Joseph et al., 2017; Zanella et al., 2018). Also, prediction equations to determine RMR work poorly in people with obesity, so caution should be used when estimating RMR via a prediction equation when working with obese clients (Madden et al., 2016; Spears et al., 2009).

### THERMIC EFFECT OF FOOD

TEF is the number of calories that are expended to break down the components of a meal (Secor, 2009). In other words, it takes energy (calories) to digest food. On average, around 7â€“10% of the calories contained in foods go toward their own digestion and absorption. In general, protein results in a higher TEF, meaning it takes more calories to break down protein foods compared to carbohydrates or fats.
