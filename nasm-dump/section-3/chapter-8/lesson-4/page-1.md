# Daily Energy Needs

When daily food intake is matched to energy needs, people are said to be in energy balance, which allows them to maintain a stable body weight. However, when energy intake is higher than needed to support the total daily energy requirements, it can lead to an increase in body weight. Similarly, if individuals eat less than they need to support their daily energy requirements, they will lose weight as the body fuels itself from its internal stores. Individuals who are over their ideal weight will need to either decrease daily energy intake and/or increase daily activity to achieve their ideal weight. Conversely, people who want to gain muscle mass need to increase their daily energy intake beyond what is being used. The amount of daily energy individuals need is also impacted by their age, sex, pregnancy, existing muscle mass, hormone function, medication use, and genetic factors. As a result, individual daily energy needs vary tremendously across the population.

## Total Daily Energy Expenditure

The total number of calories that a person expends in a day is called the **total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)**. Calories are the basic unit of energy that is provided by food. Scientifically speaking, 1 Calorie (also referred to as a **kilocalorie (kcal)**) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water by 1º Celsius. But more importantly from a health and fitness perspective, calories (as commonly written on food labels) represent the units of energy that come from the food we use to stay alive, maintain body functions, move, and exercise.

### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

A calorie (lowercase c) is a unit of energy and is defined as the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1º Celsius. A kilocalorie (kcal, sometimes written as Calorie with an uppercase C) is equal to 1,000 calories. Although not scientifically correct, calories (as written on food labels) and kilocalories are used interchangeably in everyday language all around the world; however, food calories are technically kilocalories.

The number of calories that each person expends in a day varies tremendously. The calories that are burned throughout the day are used for a variety of processes besides exercise, including maintenance of the **resting metabolic rate (RMR)**, digestion and absorption of food, and general activities ranging from walking to the mailbox to typing on a keyboard. Because heat is a by-product of processing macronutrient substrates for energy, the “burning of calories” is more specifically termed *thermogenesis*. With that in mind, energy used for exercise is called **exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT)**, energy used to digest food is called the **thermic effect of food (TEF)**, and energy used for all the other daily movements and activities a person performs is called **nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)**. The combination of RMR, EAT, TEF, and NEAT combine to form TDEE.

## Key Terms

**Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)**
The total amount of energy expended in one day.

**Kilocalorie (kcal)**
One food calorie. Also, the amount of energy needed to raise one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.

**Resting metabolic rate (RMR)**
The rate at which the body expends energy (calories) when fasted and at complete rest, such as asleep or lying quietly.

**Exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT)**
The calories expended through structured exercise or training.

**Thermic effect of food (TEF)**
The energy required to digest, absorb, and process nutrients that are consumed.

**Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)**
Energy expenditure through daily activities outside of structured exercise, such as walking, completing household chores, and taking the stairs.
