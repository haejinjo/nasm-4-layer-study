## Content
- Steady-state aerobic exercise is defined as a situation in which a person engages in the same level of activity, without increases or decreases in intensity, for several minutes.

	- Intermittent exercise is defined as frequent changes in the work requirement (intensity) during an activity.

	- Exercise increases metabolic rate, and breathing rate increases in proportion with it.

	- When breathing rate becomes too rapid to allow talking, the body has shifted to oxidizing almost exclusively carbohydrate to fuel the activity.

	- Lower-intensity activities use a higher percentage of fat as a fuel but generally do not burn a lot of calories unless performed for a very long time.

	- Higher-intensity activities have a higher percentage of energy coming from carbohydrate and usually burn more total calories in a given time.

	- Daily food (energy) intake needs to be adequate to maintain a healthy body weight, allow for proper bodily function, and support physical activity.

	- If daily food intake is matched to energy needs, a person is said to be in energy balance.

	- Calories are the basic unit of energy provided by food, and the total number of calories that a person burns in a day is called the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).

	- The resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the minimum number of calories needed at rest to keep a person alive and meet all functional needs of the body.

	- The thermic effect of food (TEF) is the number of calories that are used to digest a meal.

	- Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) involves burning calories in activities that are not structured exercise.

	- Exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT) is the calories burned during structured physical activity or purposeful exercise.
