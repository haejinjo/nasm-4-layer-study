### PLANES OF MOTION, AXES, AND JOINT MOTIONS

The universally accepted method of describing human movement is in reference to three dimensions and is based on a system of three imaginary planes: sagittal, frontal, and transverse (**Figure 7-4**). These planes are positioned at right angles, so they intersect in the center. Although movements can be dominant in a single plane of motion, it is important to remember that typical daily movement rarely occurs strictly in one plane of motion. However, movements, joint motions, and many common exercises are classified as being predominantly in a specific plane of motion if they run along that plane (i.e., parallel to it). Movement patterns that take the body through motions in more than one plane are termed *multiplanar*.

Movement in each plane occurs on an axis running perpendicular to that plane, much like the axle that a car wheel revolves around. This is known as *joint motion*. Joint motions are termed for their action in each of the three planes of motion. A more specific term used to describe the movements we can observe or see is **osteokinematic**, whereas the movements taking place inside the joint itself that we cannot see are referred to as **arthrokinematic** movement (Levangie et al., 2019). Osteo- and arthrokinematic movements are both required for normal movement to occur.

## Key Terms

**Osteokinematics**
Movement of a limb that is visible.

**Arthrokinematics**
The description of joint surface movement; consists of three major types: roll, slide, and spin.
