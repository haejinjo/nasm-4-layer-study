# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

The transverse plane involves rotational movement of the head, torso, arms, and legs. In addition, movement in the transverse plane involves horizontal abduction and adduction, which can occur at either the shoulders or hips. For example, a machine chest fly exercise involves horizontal abduction and adduction at the shoulder, whereas a hip abductor machine involves horizontal abduction and adduction at the hips.

# GETTING TECHNICAL

Just like with dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, and inversion in the sagittal and frontal planes, there is unique terminology for transverse plane movement of the feet. In this context, rotating the foot outward at the ankle (with no rotation of the leg as a whole) is called abduction (toes rotating laterally), while inward rotation of the foot at the ankle is called adduction (toes pointing medially) (Hamill & Knutzen, 2003; Levangie et al., 2019).

To move the body functionally, however, the foot and ankle complex rarely performs its single plane movements in isolation. Instead, the ankle moves through its own version of pronation and supination, which is different from radioulnar pronation and supination.Â **Pronation of the foot** is a multiplanar movement consisting of the combination of eversion, dorsiflexion, and ankle abduction. **Supination of the foot** is then the combination of inversion, plantar flexion, and ankle adduction. During **gait** (walking and running), the foot and ankle complex moves between pronation during force reduction (when the foot lands) and supination during force production (when the foot pushes off the ground) with every step.

## Key Terms

**Pronation of the foot**
Multiplanar movement of the foot and ankle complex consisting of eversion, dorsiflexion, and ankle abduction; associated with force reduction.

**Supination of the foot**
Multiplanar movement of the foot and ankle complex consisting of inversion, plantar flexion, and ankle adduction; associated with force production.

**Gait**
Biomechanical motion of the lower extremities during walking, running, and sprinting.
