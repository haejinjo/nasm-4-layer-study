### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

As previously mentioned, muscles can often take on different roles depending on the joint motion that is being performed. For example, the infraspinatus muscle of the rotator cuff takes up the role of agonist (prime mover) for shoulder external rotation, the role of synergist when abducting the shoulder to reach overhead, and the role of stabilizer during other joint motions of the shoulder (Day et al., 2012; Kisner & Colby, 2007;Levangie et al., 2019).

## Open- Versus Closed-Chain Movements

In the health and fitness industry, exercises are often classified based on different load- or weight-bearing characteristics. One such classification is to describe an exercise as being either open- or closed-chain. Classifying an exercise in this manner may provide insight into muscle recruitment patterns, the degree of weight-bearing, and the number of joints involved (Kisner & Colby, 2007).
