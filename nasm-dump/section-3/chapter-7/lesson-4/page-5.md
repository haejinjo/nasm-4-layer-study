Closed-chain exercises involve applying force into an immovable object, such as the floor, wall, or pull-up bar. In other words, the hands or feet are typically fixed and do not move.

Open-chain exercises involve the ability to freely move the limbs, such as the hands and feet.

For example, a pull-up is a closed-chain exercise for the back musculature, whereas the lat pulldown is an open-chain exercise for the same muscle group.
