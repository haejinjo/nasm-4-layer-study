## Content
- Motions of the scapulae include scapular retraction, scapular protraction, scapular depression, and scapular elevation.

	- Muscle actions are described as isotonic, isometric, and isokinetic.

	- Isotonic muscle actions can be broken down into the concentric and eccentric phases.

	- Muscles can play the role of agonist, synergist, stabilizer, or antagonist depending on the movement being performed.

	- Closed-chain movements anchor the body to the ground or immovable object, whereas open-chain movement involves the distal limb moving freely in space.

	- Placing a muscle in a shortened position or lengthening a muscle beyond optimal length may reduce force output, because optimal length is the position with maximal overlap of actin and myosin filaments.

	- The stretch-shortening cycle involves three phases, which include the eccentric phase, amortization phase, and concentric phase.

	- The term* force-couple *is used to describe muscles that work in a synergistic function around a joint.

	- The local muscular system involves muscles that generally attach on or near the spine and provide stability for the LPHC.

	- The global muscle system can be broken down into subsystems, which include the deep longitudinal, posterior oblique, anterior oblique, and lateral subsystems.

	- The subsystems describe the integrated function of muscle groups to transfer force for complex multijoint movements and stabilization of the HMS.

	- The amount of force produced by the HMS relies on not only muscle recruitment but also the lever type of the joint that is moving.

	- Lever systems are classified as first, second, and third class. Third-class levers are the most predominate levers in the human body.

	- Muscle synergies describe the cooperative function of multiple muscles recruited by the nervous system to complete a given movement pattern.

	- Proprioception is the intrinsic awareness of movement and bodily position in space.

	- Feedback can come from internal or external sources and aids the process of motor learning.

	- Motor learning is the integration of motor control processes, with practice and experience, leading to a relatively permanent change in the capacity to produce skilled movements.
