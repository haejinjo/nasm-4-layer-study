## Content
Informal roles may include those who tend to inspire the group, provide mentorship to new members, or plan social gatherings. It has been noted that for intact exercise groups that strongly identify as a distinct group, those members also perceive a social connection with each other and group cohesion. However, the process by which individuals in an exercise environment actually become a group is not well understood (Evans et al., 2019a). People are drawn to group exercise for many different reasons and often for more than one reason. **Table 3-4** displays some possible reasons why people are drawn to group exercise and possible benefits.

**TABLE 3-4 Benefits of Group Exercise**

| Reason | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Accountability | Being part of an exercise group brings accountability for regular attendance, both from members of the group and the exercise leader. |
| Comparison | Participants have people they can compare themselves against; the ability to see what others can do and achieve can serve as further motivation. |
| Competition | Group environments can bring about friendly competition among participants or within individuals to reach their personal best. |
| Comradery | Individuals can form connections with people who are attempting to achieve similar results, while experiencing feelings of friendship, closeness, and loyalty. |
| Consistency | Having a schedule that allows participants to anticipate the experience will help form habits. |
| Energy | Most group exercise classes are designed to be high energy, making it an attractive environment to which people are drawn. |
| Intensity | Participants are encouraged to try the best they can, and they may work harder in the presence of the group. |
| Mindless | Since the exercise session is planned, participants just need to show up and follow instructions without thinking about designing their own workouts. |
| Motivation | Exercising with a group can by itself be a form of motivation to regularly participate. |
| Sociability | When a group or situation is warm and inviting, it brings people together; when people feel welcome, they are likely to return. |

#### TRAINING TIP

Joining an intact exercise group may be intimidating for some clients. Fitness professionals can help identify groups that share similar characteristics or goals and encourage clients to participate. If clients are unsure of their ability to fit into a group, one way to help them adjust is to attend an exercise session with them, which may help reduce insecurities about trying something new.

### THE COMMUNITY

The community plays a unique role in exercise behavior based on the opportunities available for people to be physically active. There is evidence that the physical surroundings, also known as the built environment, has a strong influence over activity levels in a community.

The number of sidewalks and walking and biking paths available can impact peopleâ€™s activity levels. It is important to note that communities vary quite a bit in terms of resources, safety, transportation, and social norms. Active communities will likely have more green space, walking trails, playgrounds, sidewalks, and biking trails, as well as an emphasis on safe public transportation and neighborhoods. Being aware of the opportunities or challenges of participating in exercise outside of a fitness facility will help clients make decisions about how to best maximize an active lifestyle.
