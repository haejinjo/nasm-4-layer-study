## Content
- Informational support is one of the main reasons why someone will seek out a fitness professional; it includes providing accurate and current information about fitness and exercise.

	- Companionship support is when someone exercises with another person.

	- Group influences on exercise refer to the influence held by other people over whether or not someone exercises and can come from family members, parents, exercise leaders, exercise groups, or the surrounding community.

	- Parental influence is important for children and adolescents, whereas instrumental support is often cited as the most influential type of support.

	- The exercise leader sets the tone of the class and is responsible for creating an inviting and inclusive exercise environment.

	- Once formed, exercise groups often feel distinct from others and can lead to additional accountability and encouragement.

	- The community influences exercise by the safety level of the exercise environment and the number of opportunities for exercise, which includes sidewalks, green spaces, playgrounds, and walking trails.

	- Exercise provides several psychological benefits that can enhance overall well-being, including improved mood, better sleep quality, increased self-esteem, improved body image, and fewer depression and anxiety symptoms.
