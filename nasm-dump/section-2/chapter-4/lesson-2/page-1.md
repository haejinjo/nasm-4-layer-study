# The Stages of Change Model

The Stages of Change model (also known as the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change) views change as a process that involves progression through a series of stages (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). These stages are **precontemplation**, **contemplation**, **preparation**, **action**, and **maintenance** (**Figure 4-1**). The model was originally conceived as a means to help people quit smoking, but it can be applied to virtually any situation where a person is trying to break bad habits and form new positive ones. In regard to personal fitness, the stages of change reference a person’s readiness to begin and adhere to an exercise program:

	- Precontemplation stage: the individual does not exercise and is not planning to start exercising within the next 6 months

	- Contemplation stage: the individual does not currently exercise but is planning to start within 6 months

	- Preparation stage: the individual is planning to begin exercising soon and has taken steps toward it and may even be sporadically exercising

	- Action stage: the individual has been exercising for less than 6 months

	- Maintenance stage: the individual has been exercising consistently for 6 months or more (Glanz et al., 2008; Spencer et al., 2006)
