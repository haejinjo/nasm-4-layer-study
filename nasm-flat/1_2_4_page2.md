### PROSPECTING AND LEAD GENERATION

Prospecting for new clients is an integral part of every fitness professional’s working day. Without meeting new people and developing a pipeline of potential clients, even the most skilled Certified Personal Trainer will fail in their career. Without that pipeline, client needs will never be uncovered, and personal training programs will never be sold.

Prospects are potential sales leads that can be converted to paying clients. They are not just random people off the street; rather, they are individuals who the fitness professional has already identified as being potentially interested in fitness services. Prospects can be identified in a few ways:

	- Asking for referrals from existing clients

	- **Working the floor** to meet as many facility members as possible and building **rapport**

	- Obtaining warm leads provided by the member and/or sales department

	- Answering inquiries from social media and other marketing streams

To continue receiving warm leads, health clubs will commonly offer one or more complimentary personal training sessions to new members when they sign up. This creates a low-pressure opportunity for Certified Personal Trainers to demonstrate their expertise and market their services to an already captive audience. This is an additional benefit of working in a large health club, because many commercial health clubs may sell dozens to a few hundred new memberships per month. Each new member is a potential client for the fitness professionals working at the facility.

In these types of facilities, the management team will have a system for distributing new member information among the fitness staff. However, every facility is different, and warm leads from new member sales should not be expected or relied on. Fitness professionals must always build rapport with the existing membership base and demonstrate their professionalism every day, viewing new member complimentary sessions as a bonus to the lead generation process.

Generating sales leads outside of the health club environment becomes a little more challenging because it is up to the fitness professional to develop and distribute all branding and marketing materials to uncover potential clients. One highly recommended tactic is to net-work with other service-based businesses in the area that also cater to a health-conscious clientele. Doctor’s offices, physical therapy clinics, massage therapy studios, chiropractic offices, and weight-loss centers are all service-based professional businesses that cater to consumers who may also see the value in working with a Certified Personal Trainer. Complementary service-based businesses can be identified through the local chamber of commerce or other business networking groups. Then, it all comes back to the same task that fitness professionals perform on the floors of health clubs every day: building rapport and uncovering a prospect’s fitness needs.

#### TRAINING TIP

When working the floor, it is important to get to know as many health club members as possible; however, it is equally important to not be too pushy or aggressive. This can be accomplished by keeping the atmosphere light and pleasant. The goal is simple: make a quick introduction, learn the name of the prospect, start building rapport, and then step away without mentioning anything related to sales. Then, as you have repeated interactions with the prospective client, fitness needs can be naturally uncovered, and solutions can be presented without ever having to “sell.”
