### SKINFOLD ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCERNS

The different skinfold assessment protocols as described can provide many options when assessing a client’s body fat percentage. While providing the fitness professional with options, it can also prove to be confusing about which protocol to use. Some simple guidelines can simplify the decision-making process.

	- Although the seven-site method is considered the most accurate because it collects SKFs at more locations across the body, this protocol is certainly more invasive to the client. As such, it may be best used for clinical or athletic populations.

	- While the Jackson and Pollock three-site protocol is perhaps not as accurate as the seven-site protocol, it is still considered valid. An advantage is that the three-site protocol is less invasive to conduct.

	- The Durnin–Womersley formula is best used for individuals between the ages of 17 and 49 years of age and may not be as applicable for older adults. A potential advantage is that it only requires measurements for the upper body; it does not require an individual to wear shorts for a thigh measurement.

#### TRAINING TIP

Assessing body fat using skinfold calipers can be a sensitive situation. Additionally, the accuracy of the SKFs for obese individuals decreases; thus, it would be more appropriate not to use this method for assessing body fat. Instead, use bioelectrical impedance, circumference measurements, scale weight, or even the fit of clothing to evaluate one’s weight loss and body fat reduction progress.
