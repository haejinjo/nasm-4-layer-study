Exercises can also be progressed in this category by decreasing one’s base of support. For example, the same cable row sequence (two-arm, alternating-arm, one-arm) can be advanced to a single-leg stance to further challenge the client’s posture, balance, and joint stability (**Figure 20-10**).

Lastly, stabilization-focused resistance exercises can be progressed to increase stabilization demands of the upper extremities by using unique loading patterns and specialized equipment. For example, the kettlebell bottoms-up exercise is a unique loading pattern that challenges both core and shoulder stability (**Figure 20-11**), whereas the Earthquake Bar is a unique tool that simultaneously challenges upper-extremity stability and strength (**Figure 20-12**).
