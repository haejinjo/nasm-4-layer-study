# Introduction to Cardiorespiratory Fitness Training

**Cardiorespiratory fitness** reflects the ability of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to supply oxygen-rich blood to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity. Cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the five components to health-related physical fitness; the others include muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Cardiorespiratory fitness is vitally important to health and wellness as well as to the ability to engage in normal **activities of daily living (ADL)** without excessive fatigue. Physical activity and exercise training programs should be designed with the intent of improving each of the key components of health-related physical fitness; however, from the standpoint of preventing chronic disease and improving health and quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness training should always be near top priority when allocating time and resources during the design and implementation of any exercise training program because of the number of health-related benefits associated with it (Anderson et al., 2016; Thorogood et al., 2011).
