### ARCHING QUADRICEPS

The arching quadriceps stretch is designed to stretch the quadriceps and hip flexors (**Figure 14-22**). This position places very high stress on the kneecap and the other tissues on the front of the knee joint. Any client with a history of knee injury should avoid this stretch. Owing to the high stress (compression) of the kneecap into the knee during this stretch (which may cause damage to the cartilage), most healthcare professionals discourage anyone from performing this exercise.

The fitness professional must recognize that some individuals, such as athletes, may need to perform the stretches because the position is required for their sport or activity. For instance, the inverted hurdler’s stretch mimics the position of a hurdler going over a hurdle. Others are traditional positions used in martial arts, gymnastics, or yoga. However, for most clients, there are safer positions that can be used to stretch the targeted muscles. Therefore, all clients should be properly educated about stretching technique and posture, and the safest exercises should be used to meet the goals of the exercise program.
