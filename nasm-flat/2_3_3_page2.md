### CRITICAL

Fitness professionals can help clients determine if a website is providing reliable information or not. First, look at who is responsible for the information. There should be an easily identified source with contact information such as colleges and universities, government agencies, and well-known organizations (e.g., the World Health Organization). Also, if a product or service is being advertised, such as a product for weight loss, caution should always be used. Helping clients sort through fact versus fiction will ensure their safety and ultimately their success.

When first meeting with clients, one priority should be to determine the types of social influence in their lives and whether or not these influences are supportive of the exercise behavior. For example, do they have an exercise partner, or do they have a strong emotional support system? Most often, past success or failure with exercise can be connected to the amount of social support for the behavior. Helping clients differentiate between someone’s support for their desire to exercise versus someone who is indifferent or unsupportive will help determine the influence level regarding the types of support received by certain individuals.

A client may also have conflicting influences, which cause them to be torn between time to exercise and other obligations. Regardless of the type of social influence that touches a person, changing behavior will likely be due to (and with the assistance of) some type of influence or support. When clients do not have adequate social support available, fitness professionals can play a key role in making the fitness facility an inviting place where clients feel they are supported. This can be done by introducing clients to the staff and members, finding group exercise classes that appeal to the client, or providing small group training sessions for people with common interests or goals. The important thing is to provide additional opportunities for people to connect and build a healthy community, especially for those who do not have strong support systems.

## Types of Support

Social support can come from a variety of sources, including family, friends, and fitness professionals, and the several types of support can include instrumental, emotional, informational, and companionship support (**Table 3-2**). Due to the individual nature of social support and the way it relates to exercise behavior, it is a topic that is still not fully understood by practitioners (Scarapicchia et al., 2017). The source and type of support considered as useful and meaningful will differ among individuals; it can change based on phase of life, proximity to family and friends, and the overall environment.

**TABLE 3-2 Types of Social Support**

| Type of Support | Example |
|---|---|
| Instrumental | Providing transportation to a fitness facility

Paying for someone’s gym membership

Watching children to allow a parent to exercise |
| Emotional | Encouraging someone to exercise

Providing positive feedback

Listening to someone when they are frustrated with exercise

Being empathetic by communicating an understanding of how someone feels |
| Informational | Giving sound advice about how to achieve optimal health and fitness

Providing education about the current recommendations for physical activity

Educating people about the risk of poor health accompanying a sedentary lifestyle |
| Companionship | Exercising with someone

Accompanying someone during an exercise session

Finding physically active options for social gatherings |

While the role of the fitness professional as a source of social support is not well documented, based on client expectations, some forms of social support (such as informational and companionship) should be assumed for the trainer–client relationship. The phase of life has a strong influence over the origin of social support. For example, children and adolescents are most influenced by parents and other family members, while the emphasis shifts to friends for young adults, and older adults rely on family members for support to exercise (Belanger & Patrick, 2018; Lindsay Smith et al., 2017; Mutz & Albrecht, 2017).

## Key Terms

The actions that directly facilitate a behavior to happen. In the context of exercise, instrumental support can include driving a person to a health club or paying for the gym membership.
