### Static Standing TFL Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Stand in a staggered stance with the front leg slightly bent and rear leg straight. Externally rotate the rear foot, draw in the navel, and posteriorly rotate the pelvis. Squeeze the gluteal muscles of the side being stretched. As a progression, raise the arm (on the same side as the back leg) up and over to the opposite side while maintaining pelvis position. Hold side bend position as illustrated.

### Static Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Kneel with front and back legs flexed at a 90-degree angle. Draw in the navel and posteriorly rotate the pelvis. Squeeze the gluteal muscles of the side being stretched. As a progression, raise the arm (on the same side as the back leg) up and over to the opposite side while maintaining pelvis position. Hold side bend position and slowly rotate posteriorly as illustrated. To emphasize the TFL, externally rotate the rear leg, whereas to emphasize the psoas, internally rotate the rearÂ leg.
