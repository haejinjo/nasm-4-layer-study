## Content
Thus, strength-training machines are commonly used by novice lifters to perform **supersets** and **circuit-training** workouts. Additionally, selectorized strength-training machines do not require the use of a spotter.

Although strength-training machines are sometimes less intimidating, they do have their share of disadvantages. Strength machines are thought of as inferior to free weights for improving **core stability** and muscular coordination because they offer artificial support versus using one’s core musculature to provide the **stability** (Stone et al., 2002; Vinstrup et al., 2015). Machines oftentimes fail to accommodate total-body movements that can incorporate the use of both the upper and lower extremities simultaneously (Stone et al., 2002). Moreover, not all strength-training machines are designed to fit all body types, which can limit the effectiveness of the exercise and possibly create more stress to joints. Lastly, selectorized strength-training machines primarily work in one plane of motion and can limit one’s ability to develop strength in all **planes of motion** (Saeterbakken & Fimland, 2012).

# HELPFUL HINT

It is important for the Certified Personal Trainer to understand the limitations of selectorized strength-training machines when working with those who are obese, short, or very tall in stature or physically unable to properly use the equipment as intended.

During the initial stages of training, the use of selectorized strength-training machines by apparently healthy adults may be necessary to offer a less intimidating environment and to provide a strength-training option that meets their current physical capabilities. Eventually, through proper instruction and education, fitness professionals should strive to progress individuals into more **proprioceptively enriched environments** to improve joint mobility and stability and movement patterns. For example, a client may begin by using a machine to perform a shoulder press exercise during their initial week of training before progressing to using dumbbells to perform a seated shoulder press exercise and eventually a standing shoulder press (**Figure 22: -1**).

## Key Terms

**Superset**
Two exercises performed back to back in rapid succession with minimal to no rest.

**Circuit training**
As series of exercises performed one after another with minimal (or limited) rest.

**Core stability**
The ability of an individual to maintain a given position, adequately stabilizing the spine while the extremities are moving.

**Stability**
The resistance to the external disruptions to one’s equilibrium.

**Planes of motion**
The planes of movement in which the human body moves, which includes the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.

**Proprioceptively enriched environment**
An unstable (yet controllable) exercise environment that causes the body to use its internal balance and stabilization mechanisms.
