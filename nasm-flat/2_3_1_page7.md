## Content
Motivation also plays a role in the types of exercise that people seek out: extrinsically motivated people seek opportunities that emphasize physical transformation or competition, and intrinsically motivated people tend to seek opportunities focused on health and wellness (Brown et al., 2017). Therefore, learning what motivates individuals will go a long way toward providing them with the opportunities they prefer, which will ultimately lead to client satisfaction.

Helping clients determine their motivation to exercise can go beyond simply asking them why they want to participate. Validated surveys are available that can be distributed to help clients objectively identify motives. One of these surveys is the Exercise Motivation Inventory-2 (Markland & Ingledew, 1997). This survey identifies 14 subscales of possible motives with higher scores on any given motive indicating its potential importance to an individual. The Exercise Motivation Inventory-2 survey can be found by performing a quick internet search. It is designed for exercisers and nonexercisers alike, making it ideal for new and existing clients. Another benefit of using an objective scale is that it will be easier to reassess motives over time, since motivation to exercise may change for some people. Tracking these changes will help fitness professionals adjust their personal programs.
