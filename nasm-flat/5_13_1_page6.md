## Content
When programming for optimal posture, the fitness professional will use appropriate flexibility and strengthening techniques to help correct **muscle imbalances** and include **unilateral/bilateral** and anterior/posterior exercises to create symmetry between right/left and front/back sides of the body (Speirs et al., 2016). Without creating a balanced attack inside of a systematic program, maintaining or improving posture will be limited. The recipe for success is an integrated approach to program design. Flexibility, core, balance, plyometric, and resistance training exercises are all useful forms of exercise to improve posture. Cardiorespiratory exercise may also prove beneficial due to changes in body composition (e.g., reduced body fat) and improvements in muscular endurance.

## Training for Optimal Range of Motion

Like posture, working within an optimal **range of motion (ROM)** allows joints to move freely. Clients are often plagued by muscle imbalance, poor posture, or joint restrictions. As a consequence, ROM at certain joints can become restricted, which limits movement and may lead to injury. For example, limitations in hip mobility have been implicated in hip, spine, and lower extremity dysfunction (Reiman & Matheson, 2013).

Conversely, complete ROM means the body is not limited or restricted. In other words, complete ROM is the ability of a joint to move freely between the open and closed portion of the joint movement (Keogh et al., 2019). This also relates to the concentric and eccentric actions of the muscles that allow the joint to open and close.

The fitness professional must understand that restrictions of a particular ROM may occur because a prior injury may have caused scar tissue to form, which changes the mechanics of the joint. Ultimately, clients may have to work within specific constraints and use caution to avoid causing further injury to that area. On the other hand, an individual who does not have a limited ROM should work through all ROMs to maximize exercise adaptations. Training for optimal ROM requires patience by both the client and fitness professional because many factors come into play when dealing with the appropriate range for every person.

## Training in All Planes of Motion

Fitness professionals should develop exercise programs to require movement in all three planes of motion: sagittal, frontal, and transverse. A common mistake made in the fitness industry is to develop exercise programs that overly emphasize the sagittal plane of motion (front-to-back motions) and neglect exercises in the frontal (side-to-side motions) and transverse planes (rotational motions). The advantage to the body working in all three planes of motion is the enhancement of muscle recruitment. For example, the posterior fibers of the gluteus medius concentrically perform hip abduction and hip external rotation (**Figure 13-2**). As such, to effectively target all muscle fibers of the gluteus medius, the client must perform a variety of movements at the hips (abduction, external rotation). In other words, simply performing common hip extension exercises (e.g., squats, lunges) does not effectively target the gluteus medius muscles.

In addition, many injuries occur in the frontal and transverse planes of motion (Barwick et al., 2012; Padua et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2008). Unfortunately, when a client does not train in all three planes of motion, the fitness professional is limiting that client’s body to move efficiently, thereby diminishing ideal movement and athleticism. Therefore, selection of a variety of exercises in all planes of motion is a critical component of a client’s training program.

## Key Terms

**Muscle imbalance**
When muscles on each side of a joint have altered length-tension relationships.

**Unilateral**
Relating to one side of the body.

**Bilateral**
Relating to two sides of the body.

**Range of motion (ROM)**
The degree to which specific joints or body segments can move; often measured in degrees.
