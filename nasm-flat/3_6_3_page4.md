## Content
Hours after a meal, or as a result of a combination of normal metabolic processes and physical activity, the body will begin to exhibit lower blood glucose levels. The drop in circulating blood glucose levels triggers the release of glucagon from the pancreas. In contrast to insulin, which has many effects, glucagon has a much more specific effect; it stimulates the liver to convert its glycogen stores back into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Glucagon would, in the acute setting, have the opposite effects of insulin with respect to lipolysis (fat burning) (Qaid & Abderlrahman, 2016). However, it is unclear whether or not this effect would occur with chronic elevations of glucagon.

### THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE

Understanding the effect of exercise is helpful in understanding the interrelationship between insulin and glucagon. As activity levels increase, glucose uptake by the body’s cells will also increase. This is the result of an increased sensitivity of the cells to insulin as well as the uptake of glucose through noninsulin-mediated mechanisms; thus, insulin levels will drop during physical activity. At the same time, glucagon secretion by the pancreas increases, thus helping to maintain a steady supply of blood glucose.

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Evidence suggests that exercise helps muscle cells increase their ability to use insulin to transport glucose into the cells. This effect essentially decreases insulin resistance, although primarily in the short term (Keshel & Coker, 2015). Furthermore, evidence indicates that insulin sensitivity improvements may occur independent of diet and weight loss (Bird & Hawley, 2016).

## Adrenal, Pituitary, and Reproductive Hormones

The adrenal and pituitary glands serve numerous bodily functions, ranging from metabolism to growth and recovery. The adrenal glands are located in the abdominal region above the kidneys and are comprised of the adrenal cortex and medulla. The adrenal glands, when stimulated, release catecholamines and cortisol.

The pituitary gland is located just below the hypothalamus in the brain; this gland is sometimes referred to as the master gland, owing to its control over many other endocrine glands. In the health and fitness profession, the pituitary gland is often recognized because it is responsible for the secretion of **growth hormone**. However, by way of its ability to stimulate other endocrine glands, the pituitary gland also has a major role in the reproductive hormones.

### CATECHOLAMINES

The two **catecholamines**—epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine—are hormones produced by the adrenal glands, which are situated on top of each kidney. Specifically, they are produced by the inner adrenal medulla. These hormones help prepare the body for activity; more specifically, they are part of the stress response known as the fight-or-flight response.

## Key Terms

**Growth hormone**
An anabolic hormone produced by the pituitary gland that is responsible for growth and development.

**Catecholamines**
Hormones produced by the adrenal glands that are part of the stress response known as the fight-or-flight response.
