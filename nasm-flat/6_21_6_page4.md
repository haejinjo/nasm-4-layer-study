**Figures 21-18**, **21-19**, and **21-20** illustrate the monthly plans for February through April. As with the previous months, these plans demonstrate a 4-day-per-week workout plan, with scheduled workouts on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, using a split routine for body parts. Cardio can be done on the workout days (or any other day during the week, depending on the clientâ€™s schedule).
