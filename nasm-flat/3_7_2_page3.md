# HELPFUL HINT

To better understand the sagittal plane, imagine being stuck in a very narrow hallway with no room to move to the left or right or to rotate in any fashion. In addition, the walls are made completely of glass, which you don’t want to break. Based on this analogy, the only available movements in our narrow sagittal plane hallway are front-to-back and up-and-down movements.

Flexion and extension occur in many joints in the body, including the spine, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, foot, and hand. At the ankle, flexion is referred to as **dorsiflexion** and extension is **plantar flexion **(Levangie et al., 2019). Examples of predominantly sagittal plane exercises include biceps curls, triceps pushdowns, squats, front lunges, calf raises, walking, running, vertical jump, climbing stairs, and shooting a basketball.

## Key Terms

**Dorsiflexion**
Flexion occurring at the ankle.

**Plantar flexion**
Extension occurring at the ankle. Pointing the foot downwards.
