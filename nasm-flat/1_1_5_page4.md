## Content
Certified Personal Trainers are also involved in educating their clients in other areas of wellness, including general health information and basic nutritional guidance that better enables them to reach their goals. It is important for Certified Personal Trainers to take time to evaluate their clientsâ€™ lifestyle habits, both inside and outside of the gym, and apply proven coaching techniques that help their clients change unhealthy behaviors for the long term. This way, Certified Personal Trainers can ensure they are doing everything possible to help their clients meet their goals.

Additionally, Certified Personal Trainers must recognize their own areas of expertise and tailor their practice accordingly. If a Certified Personal Trainer suspects that one of their clients has a medical condition that could prevent the client from safe participation in an exercise program, the Certified Personal Trainer must refer that client to the appropriate licensed healthcare professional for evaluation and clearance.
