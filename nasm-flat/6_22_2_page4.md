## Content
This form of resistance is designed to engage the core by integrating torso rotational movements and **antirotational exercises**, via **asymmetrical resistance loading**. Training in this manner has been shown to be beneficial to strengthen the core, balance, stability, power, and coordination (Kibler et al., 2006).

Rotational movements involve a controlled twisting motion of the torso that targets several muscles of the core, including (but not limited to) the internal obliques, external obliques, and hip rotators. Conversely antirotational exercises are performed from a stationary trunk position. These exercises target the deep muscles of the core and stabilize the **lumbar spine** and are often unilateral in nature.

As with any other modality, proper form should never be compromised, especially when using external load resistance. Similar to elastic bands and tubing, the TRX Rip Trainer can be used in all phases of the OPT model, but it may not be the ideal modality when heavy loads are required.

### GETTING TECHNICAL

The **thoracic spine**, not the lumbar spine, is where most trunk rotation should take place. The overall range of motion of the lumbar spine is about 12–13 degrees in a healthy individual, whereas the thoracic spine has a range of motion of nearly 70 degrees of rotation, 35 degrees in each direction (Johnson et al., 2012).

## Medicine Balls

Medicine balls are weighted balls that come in an assortment of weights and sizes, and they are made with a variety of materials. They are one of the oldest means of resistance training dating back to the Greeks and Egyptians nearly 3,000 years ago. The name *medicine ball* came from early use by physicians who used them in the rehabilitation process.

## Key Terms

**Antirotational exercises**
Core exercises performed in a manner in which the exerciser resists forces that cause torso rotation; often unilateral in nature.

**Asymmetrical resistance loading**
Unequal or uneven resistance force. Examples include using different loads for each extremity or performing unilateral exercises.

**Lumbar spine**
The lumbar region of the spine, more commonly known as the low back, which consists of five vertebrae labeled L1–L5.

**Thoracic spine**
Composed of 12 vertebral bodies (T1–T12) that make up the midregion of the spine. Attached to the rib cage at each level of the thoracic spine providing stability and structural support.
