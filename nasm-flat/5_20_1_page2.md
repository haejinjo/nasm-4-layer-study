Careful consideration must be taken to adequately meet the many facets of exercise principles, including any manipulation of training variables throughout the planned program. By adhering to certain fundamental principles, the fitness professional needs to ensure that workout programs produce the desired outcomes. A variety of essential training principles should guide the development of effective training programs, especially resistance training. Programs that fail to address these fundamental principles may be at risk for lower exercise adherence and increased risk of injury.
