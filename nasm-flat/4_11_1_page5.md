## Health History Questionnaire (HHQ)

A thorough pre-exercise **health history questionnaire (HHQ)** collects relevant information on the individual’s past and present health and serves to complement the PAR-Q+ in expanding one’s understanding of the participant’s health (see Appendix A). This questionnaire is not normally standardized to the fitness industry, but rather customized to respective facilities or organizations. In fact, a health history may be accompanied by a verbal discussion and perhaps additional questionnaires designed to gather further information regarding exercise history, eating behaviors, and general lifestyle.

## Key Terms

**Health history questionnaire (HHQ)**
A questionnaire with lists of questions that pertain to health history and habits, such as exercise history, eating behaviors, and general lifestyle.
