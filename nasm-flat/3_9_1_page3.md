## Content
Without proper nutrition, an individual’s training could be greatly compromised, whether the training is geared toward fat loss, muscle gain, or sports performance. This chapter provides an outline of basic nutrition concepts, including an overview of the macronutrients and micronutrients, and highlights the ways in which nutrients play an important role in maintaining both health and athletic performance. The chapter also provides a high-level overview of nutrition strategies that may be helpful for clients who have goals for fat loss, muscle gain, or improved sports performance

## Scope of Practice: Personal Trainers and Registered Dietitians

Fitness professionals should have a basic understanding of nutrition principles so that they can integrate appropriate nutrition guidelines into training protocols with their clients. However, it is also important for fitness professionals to recognize and respect their scope of practice versus that of licensed and registered dietitians (RDs) and **CDNs **who are legally qualified to prescribe medical nutrition therapy. **Scope of practice **refers to the areas, actions, and processes practitioners may undertake or perform that are within the bounds of their professional license or certification. In the United States, registered dietitians have extensive training in the field of food and nutrition through an accredited college or university with supervised coursework and fieldwork that is approved by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics. They are required to complete 1,000 hours of supervised training prior to taking a national examination to obtain the RD credential and must complete continuing education requirements to maintain their credential. Licensed dietitians pursue a similar path to obtain their license to practice as a dietitian but may opt for a state-approved examination versus the national RD exam. Other credentials that qualify individuals to provide nutrition recommendations are provided in **Table 9-1**, although these are still subject to individual state regulations. Similar standards also exist for dietitians in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and abroad.

**TABLE 9-1 Nutrition Credentials and Qualifications**

Registered
Dietitian
Nutritionist (RD/RDN) | Nationally recognized and credentialed in nutrition by the Commission on Dietetic Registration. Scope of practice ranges from clinical nutrition to community, food service, and nutrition education. Some RDs are board certified in Sports Dietetics (CSSD) for advanced credentialing and specialization in sports nutrition. Although nationally recognized, some states may still require RDs to obtain state licensure prior to practicing independently or in a clinical or medical setting. |
| Certified Nutritionist | It is important to determine which organization is providing the certification in nutrition and if the organization is accredited. The accredited organizations are officially recognized and authorized to provide a qualification, because they have been reviewed by other governing bodies and found to meet or exceed the minimum standards for education. |
| CISSN | Certified in Sports Nutrition by the International Society of Sports Nutrition. |
| CNS | Certified Nutrition Specialist by the Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists. |
| CDN or LDN | State Certified Dietitian/Nutritionist or Licensed Dietitian/Nutritionist. This is a license to practice nutrition in the certifying/licensing state. This licensure may be legally required in some states, for both RDs and non-RDs, prior to providing any nutrition counseling. |
