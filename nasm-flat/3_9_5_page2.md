### WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS

The water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C and the B vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, biotin, and pantothenic acid. **Table 9-16** lists the water-soluble vitamins, their primary functions, and good food sources of these nutrients.

**TABLE 9-16 Water-Soluble Vitamins**

| Water-Soluble Vitamin | Primary Roles | Food Sources |
|---|---|---|
| C | Antioxidant
	Collagen synthesis
	Possible immune support | Most fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits, kiwi, strawberries, cantaloupe, acai berries, lingonberries, and cranberries
	Some vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, potatoes) |
| Thiamin (B1) | Energy metabolism
	Prevention of beriberi disease (inflammation or degeneration of the heart and nerves) | Most meats, poultry, fish, pork (animal products)
	Fortified cereal |
| Riboflavin (B2) | Energy metabolism
	Prevention of cheilosis (inflammation or small cracks at the corners of the mouth) | Dairy
	Most animal proteins
	Fortified cereals |
| Niacin (B3) | Energy metabolism
	Prevention of pellagra disease (dementia, diarrhea, and dermatitis) | Most animal proteins
	Fortified cereals
	Beans, legumes |
| Pyridoxine (B6) | Energy metabolism
	Transamination and deamination of amino acids
	Conversion of tryptophan to niacin | Most animal proteins
	Fortified cereals
	Beans, legumes |
| Folate (B9) | DNA and RNA synthesis
	Red blood cell synthesis
	Prevention of neural tube defects (brain or spinal cord birth defects)
	Role in prevention of cancer
	Energy metabolism | Green, leafy vegetables (spinach, Swiss chard, kale, mustard greens, collard greens), asparagus
	Oranges
	Orange juice |
| Cobalamin (B12) | Energy metabolism
	DNA and RNA synthesis
	Nerve signaling
	Methylation reactions | Animal proteins (meat, poultry, fish, dairy)
	Nutritional yeast |
