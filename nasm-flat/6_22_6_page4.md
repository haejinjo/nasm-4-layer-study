In fact, some boutique and large-scale gyms require attendees to wear HRMs while taking classes. While this is done to ensure safety, it is also used to monitor exertion levels during class. Using a HRM provides objective and quantifiable data regarding a person’s heart response to exercise. HRMs also provide information regarding a person’s recovery heart rate following exercise.

HRMs measure the amount of times the heart beats in a 1-minute cycle. A faster heart rate indicates a higher level of physical exertion. As such, individuals can use HRMs to objectively measure their own level of effort. The most common types of HRMs are chest strap monitors and wristband/watch with built in optical LED sensors (**Figure 22-3: 3**).

Although wristband/watches are the most convenient and most widely used HRM, chest strap monitors provide the most accurate readings. Furthermore, wrist-worn devices are less accurate when the user is performing higher-intensity activities and may be prone to more inaccurate readings when performing upper body movements (Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2017).

# CRITICAL

How quickly a person’s heart rate drops in the first minute after vigorous exercise is a good indicator of heart health. An abnormally slow return to a resting heart rate is a predictor of poor heart health.

Like fitness trackers, heart rate monitors range in price considerably depending on the quality of the HRM and the additional features offered. It is recommended for shoppers to do their homework to ensure they are getting a monitor that best suits their personal needs.

# TRAINING TIP

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization recommend 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week for optimal health.
