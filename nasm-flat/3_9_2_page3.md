Peptides are amino acids linked together via a peptide bond. A dipeptide is the combination of two amino acids linked together by a peptide bond. A tripeptide is a sequence of three amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. A polypeptide chain is a series (often more than three) of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds.

Proteins consist of many polypeptide chains held together in various structures, such as a coil, sphere, or helix, and this is referred to as the secondary structure of the protein (the polypeptide chain is considered to be the primary structure). The tertiary structure of a protein is its three-dimensional formâ€”or the way the coil, sphere, or helix folds in on itself.
