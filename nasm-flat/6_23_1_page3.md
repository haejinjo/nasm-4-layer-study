## Physiologic Differences Between Children and Adults

There are fundamental physiological differences between children and adults. Although youth may experience similar effects of exercise training as adults, they do not respond, adapt, or progress the same. Youth exercise training programs should progress specific to their physiologic capabilities. Fitness professionals should be aware of important physiologic differences between youth and adults that impact their response and adaptation to exercise. These include the following (**Table 23: -1**) (Michael & Saltarelli, 2019):

	- Peak oxygen uptake: Because children do not typically exhibit a plateau in oxygen uptake at maximal exercise, the term *peak oxygen uptake *is a more appropriate term than VO~2max~ or maximal oxygen uptake. Adjusted for body weight, peak oxygen consumption is similar for young and adult males and slightly higher for young females (compared with adult females). A similar relationship also exists for force production or strength.

	- Submaximal oxygen demand (or economy of movement): Children are less efficient and tend to exercise at a higher percentage of their peak oxygen uptake during submaximal exercise compared with adults.

	- Children do not produce sufficient levels of glycolytic enzymes to be able to sustain bouts of high-intensity exercise.

	- Children have immature thermoregulatory systems, including both a delayed response and limited ability to sweat in response to hot, humid environments.

**TABLE 23-1: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Youth**

| Physiologic Considerations | Implication of Exercise Compared with Adults | Considerations for Health and Fitness | Considerations in Sport and Athletic Training |
|---|---|---|---|
| Peak oxygen uptake is similar to adults when adjusted for body weight. | Able to perform endurance tasks relatively well | Physical activity of 60 minutes on most or all days of the week, emphasizing developmentally appropriate activities | Progression of aerobic training volume should not exceed 10% per period of adaptation (if 200 minutes per week, increase to 220 minutes before increasing intensity). |
| Submaximal oxygen demand is higher compared with adults for walking and running. | Greater chance of fatigue and heat production in sustained higher-intensity tasks | Moderate to vigorous physical activity for adolescents, for a total of 60 minutes 3 or more days of the week or 3 days per week if vigorous | Intensive anaerobic exercise (greater than 90% HRmax) exceeding 10 seconds is not well tolerated; provide sufficient rest and recovery intervals between intense bouts of training. |
| Glycolytic enzymes are lower than adults. | Decreased ability to perform longer-duration (10–90 seconds), high-intensity tasks | Resistance exercise for muscular fitness:

1–2 sets of 8–10 exercises

8–12 reps per exercise | Resistance exercise should emphasize balance, skill, and controlled movements.

Repetitions should not exceed 6–8 per set for strength development or 20 for enhanced muscular endurance. |
| Sweating rate | Decreased tolerance to environmental extremes, particularly heat and humidity | 2–3 days per week, duration of 30 minutes, with added time for warm-up and cool-down | 2–3 days per week, with increases in overload occurring through increases in reps first, then resistance. |
