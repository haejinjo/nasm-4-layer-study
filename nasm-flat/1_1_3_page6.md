## Content
A helpful method for every individual to keep blood pressure at healthy levels is regular exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve factors linked to cardiovascular health, resulting in lower blood pressure (Nam, 2011). Additionally, a fiber-rich diet with plenty of vegetables, whole grains, and fruit significantly helps reduce blood pressure (Siervo et al., 2015). Other evidence-based practice recommendations to reduce and control blood pressure include learning stress-reduction techniques and avoiding both smoking and excessive alcohol use.

Becoming more physically active can lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 4–9 mm Hg (Carpio-Rivera et al., 2016). For individuals diagnosed with hypertension, the typical approach to treatment is a combination of overall lifestyle modification (e.g., smoking cessation, diet improvement, and increased physical activity) and medication. Planned exercise alone is typically insufficient for acutely lowering and controlling hypertension. However, when looking at the bigger picture, exercise also helps lower and control body weight, improve blood flow, and reduce stress and anxiety, all of which have a positive impact on reducing and controlling blood pressure in the long run (Moraes-Silva et al., 2017).

### CHOLESTEROL

Elevated total cholesterol (medically referred to as dyslipidemia) is a major cause of disease burden in both the developed and developing world. Chronically elevated cholesterol levels increase the risks of heart disease and stroke (CDC, 2020c; Park et al., 2018). Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in blood that is made up of a combination of protein and fatty acids, known as a lipoprotein. When a healthy, balanced diet is consumed, the human body produces all of its own necessary cholesterol. The human body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, carry products in the blood, and support the nervous system.

Chronically high cholesterol can develop fatty deposits in blood vessels and can increase a person’s risk for heart disease (Nelson, 2013). Although it serves a vital bodily function, cholesterol should be frequently monitored to promote health and prevent disease, because it is a major component of the plaque that leads to atherosclerosis.

**“Good” and “Bad” Cholesterol**

There are two main types of cholesterol in the body: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL cholesterol, sometimes referred to as “bad cholesterol,” tends to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (Nelson, 2013). LDLs, specifically, are the form of cholesterol that makes up the plaque that clogs arteries. Ideally, LDL levels should be less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (O’Keefe et al., 2004).

HDL cholesterol, on the other hand, is sometimes referred to as “good cholesterol.” It does not have the tendency to clog arteries like LDL cholesterol does and, in fact, actually helps remove some LDL cholesterol from the body. To help reduce the risk of heart disease, in conjunction with lowering LDL levels below 100 mg/dL, HDL levels should typically be kept around 60 mg/dL (Grundy et al., 2018; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001).

Exercise has been shown to help reduce high cholesterol; however, researchers are not entirely sure about the optimal frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise to improve cholesterol levels (Mann et al., 2014). Being overweight tends to increase the amount of LDL cholesterol in the body, which increases the risk of heart disease.

The use of exercise to help reduce weight and control blood sugar levels will likely result in favorable reductions in LDL cholesterol levels and, therefore, overall heart disease risk. Conversely, studies have shown that individuals who regularly partake in high-intensity exercise can raise their HDL cholesterol to heart-healthy levels (Wang & Xu, 2017).
