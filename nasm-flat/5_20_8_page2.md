## Content
### Standing Cable Chest Press

---

#### TECHNIQUE

The shoulder shrug is a common compensation that occurs when performing a standing cable chest press. This can indicate overactive upper trapezius muscles, which would require additional stretching.

### Flat Dumbbell Chest Press

---

#### TECHNIQUE

When performing chest presses, the range of motion at the shoulder joint, which is indicated by how far the elbows go down, will be determined by the load one is lifting (control) and tissue extensibility. The key is only to go as far as one can control without compensating.
