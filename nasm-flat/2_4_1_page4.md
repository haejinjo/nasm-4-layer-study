## Introduction to Behavior Change Techniques

To improve coaching interventions that change behavior, Certified Personal Trainers need to identify appropriate **behavior change techniques (BCTs)**. BCTs are the active elements for intervention strategies that affect the determinants of behavior (Kok et al., 2014, 2016). For example, **self-efficacy** is a well-established determinant of exercise behavior; therefore, to promote changes that increase exercise adherence, a behavior change technique that influences self-efficacy should be used. **Table 4-1** outlines some of the most effective behavior change techniques commonly used by fitness professionals with their clients.

**TABLE 4-1 Behavior Change Techniques**

| Desired Outcome | Behavior Change Technique | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Improved self-efficacy | Set specific tasks | Break down exercises or goals into easier-to-achieve tasks. Build the stepping stones for progressively more challenging exercises or behaviors. |
| Provide instructions | Provide instructions on how to perform the behavior. This can be in person, in writing, or in video. |
| Practice for mastery | Encourage frequent practice of challenging tasks with adequate feedback to enhance learning. |
| Communicate positively | Use positive encouragement to help clients believe they have the ability to change for the better. |
| Positive outcome expectations and attitudes | Supply information | Present foundational science on the health benefits of exercise and the consequences of sedentary behavior. |
| Prompt anticipated regret | Help clients imagine how their life would be different by changing a behavior compared with the consequences of not changing it. |
| Apply motivational interviewing | Use guiding questions that prompt clients to engage in critical thinking that helps resolve ambivalence about change. |
| Manage social influence | Encourage social support | Ask clients how they plan to gain social support from friends and family. |
| Foster discipline | Help clients build skills for resisting social pressure. |
| Promote self-regulation | Make a plan | Provide detailed planning on when and where clients will engage in exercise. |
| Identify coping responses | List potential barriers and make plans to overcome each one. |
| Set SMART goals | Set both short-term and long-term goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. |
| Promote self-monitoring | Encourage clients to keep records of the specific behavior they want to change to help enhance adherence to the program. |
