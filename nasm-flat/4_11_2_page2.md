## Assessment: Safety and Legal Implications

To maximize safety and minimize legal implications, all personnel involved in exercise testing and supervision must have a current certification for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED). Within a fitness facility, the responsibilities of Certified Personal Trainers responding to emergencies should be clearly defined and documented.

### CRITICAL

An established written emergency plan should be clearly posted, including emergency medical services' telephone numbers. Regularly scheduled emergency medical services response rehearsals are advised to help improve response rates and times.

## Exercise Test Termination Criteria

During the administration of an assessment involving physical exertion (e.g., cardiorespiratory test), the fitness professional should always be aware of signs and symptoms that merit immediate termination of the test (**Figure 11-3**) and a possible referral to a medical professional (Fletcher et al., 2013; Howard et al., 2012).
