## Content
# Lipids

**Lipids** provide 9 calories per gram, compared to 4 calories per gram for carbohydrates or protein, and are considered a concentrated source of energy for active individuals. Lipids are commonly referred to as fats. However, fats are just one class of compounds within the larger family of lipids that are comprised of **triglycerides**, **phospholipids**, and **sterols**.

## Structure of Lipids

Each lipid category (triglyceride, phospholipid, and sterol) has a slightly different structure and therefore a different role and function in the body. The triglyceride family is composed of fats and oils; it comprises 98% of the stored lipids in the body and approximately 95% of the lipids in foods. Triglycerides are comprised of a glycerol backbone with three chains of fatty acids. Phospholipids have a similar structure to triglycerides but have a phosphate molecule in place of the third fatty acid chain. Sterols have a ringlike structure that is very different from both triglycerides and phospholipids (**Table 9-13**).

**TABLE 9-13 Lipids**

| Type of Lipid | Description | Food Sources/Found In |
|---|---|---|
| Triglycerides | Glycerol backbone with three fatty acid chains | Solid fats (animal and plant sources) and oils |
| Phospholipids | Glycerol backbone with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate molecule

Important component of cell membrane structures in the body | Egg yolks

Lean meats, fish, poultry

Soybeans

Grains

Seeds

Cell membranes (a thin layer that surrounds living cells) |
| Sterols | Ringlike structure of carbon and hydrogen atoms

Precursors to many hormones (estrogen, testosterone, androgen), bile, and vitamin D synthesis in the body

Part of cell membrane structure | Dietary cholesterol in animal fats (meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, egg yolks)

Cholesterol produced by the liver

Plant sterols (cholesterol in plants)

Cell membranes |

## Key Terms

**Lipids**
Group of fats/fatty acids and their derivatives, including triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols.

**Triglycerides**
The chemical or substrate form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body.

**Phospholipids**
Type of lipid (fat) comprised of glycerol, two fatty acid chains, and a phosphate group.

**Sterols**
A group of lipids with a ringlike structure. Cholesterol is a type of sterol.
