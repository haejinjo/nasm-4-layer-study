## Content
Thyroid hormones have been shown to be responsible for carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism, **basal metabolic rate (BMR)**, protein synthesis, sensitivity to epinephrine, heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature (Armstrong, 2019). In addition, the thyroid plays a critical role in bone mineral density because it releases an important hormone called calcitonin. **Calcitonin** helps the body use calcium properly to aid in maintaining bone mineral density.

Thyroid hormones tend to have a permissive effect in that they help other hormones function more effectively; in a similar way as other hormones, thyroid hormones are affected by sleep (Kessler et al., 2010). Disorders of the thyroid gland can affect almost every system in the body. Low thyroid function has become a well-recognized disorder leading to low metabolism, fatigue, depression, sensitivity to cold, and weight gain (Armstrong, 2019).

## Effects of Exercise on Hormonal Levels

Research has indicated that testosterone, growth hormone, and IGF levels increase after strength training as well as moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise (Goto et al., 2009; Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005; Roberts et al., 2010). The reasoning for these hormone increases has been covered in previous sections; however, it is important to recognize that these hormones increase in response to the need for recovery and adaptation.

A similar pattern also emerges for cortisol, where the presence of elevated cortisol in the bloodstream (elevated basal levels) is often taken to be indicative of overtraining (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005). This is perhaps too simplistic, because cortisol is a necessary part of maintaining energy levels during normal exercise activity and may even facilitate recovery and repair during the postexercise period (McArdle et al., 2016).

Problems may arise, however, as a result of extremely intense or prolonged bouts of endurance training, which have been found to lower testosterone levels while raising cortisol levels. Under these circumstances, catabolism (breakdown) is likely to outstrip anabolism (build up) and give rise to symptoms of overtraining (McArdle et al., 2014). With regard to resistance training, evidence has been found to support the increase of IGF, growth hormone, and testosterone in response to overload training of high intensity and limited rest periods (Goto et al., 2009; Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005; Roberts et al., 2010).

### TRAINING TIP

Evidence suggests that slowing down the speed of repetitions during resistance training (which increases time under tension) will increase growth hormone, testosterone, and epinephrine when compared to shorter contraction times, which are associated with reduced time under tension (Goto et al., 2009).

## Sleep and Its Effects on Hormones

Sleep is an essential physiological process that is required for all humans regardless of age or fitness level. Adequate sleep is required for normal brain functioning and development, memory, and many bodily systems, including recovery and repair. While there is a general understanding that sleep is required, the duration of sleep that constitutes a normal level, as well as the negative effects of sleep deprivation, may vary between people (Aldabal & Bahammam, 2011).

On average, most adults and adolescents sleep 5 to 6 hours per night with an estimated need for an additional 2 hours (Kessler et al., 2010; Leproult & Cauter, 2010). Sleep has been shown to directly influence hormone levels, including (but not limited to) growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and cortisol.
