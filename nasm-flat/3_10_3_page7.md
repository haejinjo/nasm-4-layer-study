## Content
In addition to providing magnesium, magnesium supplements are used to promote physical relaxation, including reduced muscle tension and vascular tension (blood pressure) (Hatzistavri et al., 2009) and improved aerobic exercise capacity (Golf et al., 1998).

True magnesium deficiency is uncommon because the kidneys naturally limit magnesium excretion as body levels become reduced. Still, magnesium deficiency is the second most common micronutrient deficiency in developed countries—about 50% in the United States (DiNicolantonio et al., 2018). When magnesium levels are low, muscle cramps and involuntary contractions may occur (Garrison et al., 2012), thus magnesium may prevent or reduce muscle cramping. Other deficiency symptoms include fatigue, vomiting, increased blood pressure, loss of appetite, numbness, and tingling.

As the kidneys regulate magnesium in the body, magnesium toxicity is unlikely, even though large doses of magnesium have been associated with diarrhea and nausea. Caution is given, however, to those with compromised kidney functions, because they might experience more severe effects from magnesium use, such as muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, and cardiac arrest (Musso, 2009).

Sodium, potassium, and chloride are not typically supplemented for health purposes, although potassium may sometimes be supplemented to make up for insufficient intake. Endurance and team sport athletes most often supplement these electrolytes to replace the electrolytes lost in sweat as either sodium chloride (table salt) and potassium chloride. The adequate amount to ingest depends on the athlete’s sweat rate and how salty their sweat is.

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

People with saltier sweat can be visually identified by allowing sweat to dry on dark clothes before washing. Salty sweat on clothes will form a white ring around the edge of the sweat when dry. The white ring is sodium.

### TRACE MINERALS

The trace minerals are iron, manganese, iodine, zinc, copper, selenium, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, and fluoride (**Figure 10-7**). Of these, iron, zinc, iodine, and chromium are the most likely to be found in supplements (DVs provided in Table 10-1).

Iron is found in food as **heme **and **nonheme** iron. Only about 10% of nonheme iron is absorbed compared to about 25% of heme iron (Monsen, 1988). Because heme iron is only found in animal flesh—and even then, only comprises about half of the iron in the food—most of the body’s iron comes from nonheme sources for those consuming a mixed diet.

## Key Terms

**Heme**
A type of iron found in animal foods.

**Nonheme**
A type of iron found in plant foods.
