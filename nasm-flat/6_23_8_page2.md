#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

This chapter covers important information and recommendations for assessing and designing exercise programs for clients with selected chronic health conditions and functional limitations. Exercise training principles used for apparently healthy adults will often be different or modified for clients with chronic health conditions or functional limitations.

	- There is a significant need for increased awareness and access to general fitness training for youths year-round, not just during one or more sport seasons.

	- Given the alarming increase in childhood obesity and diabetes, current youth fitness guidelines focus on promoting healthy lifestyles and health-related physical fitness. Current recommendations state that children and adolescents should get 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily.

	- It is important to understand that there are fundamental physiologic differences between children and adults.

	- Research has clearly demonstrated that resistance training is both safe and effective in children and adolescents.

	- Despite the normal decline in physiologic functioning associated with aging, older adults—with and without other chronic health conditions—can and do respond to exercise much in the same manner as apparently healthy younger adults.

	- By adhering to a systematic process, fitness professionals can make a dramatic impact on the overall health and well-being of older adults.

	- Regular physical activity and exercise is one of the most important factors related to long-term successful weight loss.

	- Exercise has been shown to have a substantial positive effect on the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.

	- Clients with stable coronary artery disease—especially those who have participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program—should know or be taught information on the importance and benefits of exercise, which include a lower risk of mortality, increased exercise tolerance, muscle strength, reduction in angina and heart failure symptoms, and improved psychological status and social adjustment.

	- Exercise regimens that combine resistance training to increase BMD with flexibility, core, and balance training to enhance proprioception are important for clients with osteoporosis and osteopenia.

	- It is important for fitness professionals to understand the difference between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and be aware of the signs and symptoms of an acute rheumatoid arthritis exacerbation.

	- Fitness professionals should also monitor the progress of clients with arthritis to assess the effects of the exercise program on joint pain.

	- Exercise is an important intervention for clients recovering from cancer. It can improve exercise tolerance, reduce the cellular risks associated with cancer, and improve quality of life.

	- There has been substantial research documenting the beneficial effects of exercise during pregnancy on the physiology and health of both the mother and developing fetus.

	- Clients with lung disease experience fatigue at low levels of exercise and often experience dyspnea.

	- The primary limiting factor for exercise in the client with PAD is leg pain.
