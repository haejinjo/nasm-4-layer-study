## Content
The overlapping action of the actin and myosin filaments is called the **power stroke**, which uses the molecule **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)** to provide energy to the myosin heads. After the power stroke ends, the myosin detach and move back to their original position, known as their **resting length**. Once the action potential from the CNS stops, the muscle becomes relaxed and resets itself in preparation for the next impulse from the CNS (Mackrill & Shiels, 2020; Rebbeck et al., 2014).

# HELPFUL HINT

The two major principles in sliding filament theory include the following:

	- A sarcomere shortens as a result of the Z-lines moving closer together (i.e., converging).

	- The Z-lines converge as the result of myosin filaments’ heads attaching to the actin filament’s heads, pulling the actin across the myosin, resulting in shortening of the muscle fiber.

# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

The body needs different electrolytes to help perform different muscle functions. The most essential electrolytes for muscle function include calcium, potassium, sodium, and water (Pollock et al., 2014). Calcium helps stimulate actin and myosin activity inside the muscle, and potassium and sodium help transmit the motor signal down the nerve axon. Water, which is electrically conductive, can be considered the main electrolyte of the body because it is involved in most scenarios of bodily function (Kenney et al., 2020). All these essential electrolytes can be found in the foods that we eat or achieved through supplementation. Electrolyte or water imbalance may lead to exercise-associated muscle cramps (Harris & Braun, 2017).

## Key Terms

**Power stroke**
The myosin heads bind to actin and pull them toward the sarcomere center, which slides the filaments past each other, shortening the muscle.

**Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**
A high-energy molecule that serves as the main form of energy in the human body; known as the energy currency of the body.

**Resting length**
The length of a muscle when it is not actively contracting or being stretched.
