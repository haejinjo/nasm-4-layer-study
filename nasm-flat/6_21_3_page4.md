## Content
Pulling motions involve a variety of muscles, including the biceps brachii, forearms, and back musculature. Common pulling exercises include chin-ups, pull-up variations, cobras, lat pulldowns, and rowing variations (**Figure 21-1: 0**).

#### PUSHING MOTION

Pushing motions are the counterbalance to pulling motions. Most pushing motions are associated with the upper body. Example exercises that involve upper body pushing include a barbell bench press (**Figure 21-1: 1**), dumbbell chest press, or push-ups. Concentric joint motions at the upper body include a combination of scapulae protraction, shoulder flexion, shoulder horizontal adduction, and elbow extension. The chest musculature is the prime mover for most upper body pushing exercises, whereas the triceps brachii and anterior deltoids act as **synergists **throughout the movement pattern. **Table 21: -7** provides more details regarding pushing movements.
