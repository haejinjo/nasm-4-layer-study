# Importance of Properly Training the Core Muscles

Some active individuals have developed strength, power, and muscular endurance of the global muscles of the core, which enables them to perform dynamic activities. Few people, however, have properly trained the local muscles required for intervertebral stabilization (Hodges & Richardson, 1996). The local muscles have to function efficiently for an individual to effectively use the strength, power, and endurance that has been developed in the prime movers (i.e., arms, legs). If the global muscles are strong and the local muscles are weak, forces along the kinetic chain might not be transferred or used properly. This leads to compensation, inefficient movements, and the potential for injury. Weakness of the global and local core musculature is a fundamental problem that causes inefficient movement and can lead to poor posture, decreased athletic performance, increased risk of injury, and inability to adequately return to activity following a previous injury. For this reason, properly training local and global core musculature is essential for maintaining proper posture and improving performance, as well as increasing injury resilience and enhancing injury rehabilitation.

## Scientific Rationale for Core Training

When designing a core training program, it is important to incorporate exercises specific to the needs of each client. Core training has multiple benefits; therefore, core training may be considered fundamental to many overall training programs for the vast majority of clients. Scientific evidence exists to support the importance of core training for the following key areas: optimizing posture, performance, injury resistance, and rehabilitation.
