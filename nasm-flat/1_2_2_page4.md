## Content
A professional resume should be limited to one or two pages and can be written in different formats either to feature chronological work experience or to identify specific skills aligned to the jobs where those skills were developed. The common advice is to have a one-page resume; however, if an individual has a tremendous amount of work experience, a two-page resume is acceptable. Whether a resume is one or two pages, it should highlight how an individual’s previous work experience provides them with the skills to be an effective fitness professional (**Figure 2-1**). An online search about how to write a professional resume can provide the most current and effective ways to structure a resume to attract a potential employer’s attention.
