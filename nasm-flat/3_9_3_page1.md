## Content
# Carbohydrates

The term **carbohydrate **includes a wide variety of energy-yielding compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. With the exception of fiber, carbohydrates yield 4 calories per gram (similar to protein) and are an important fuel source for the body, especially when the body is fueling physical activity. Of the three macronutrients, protein often becomes the primary nutrient of focus in the realm of sports and nutrient supplementation. However, carbo- hydrates remain equally important—if at times, not more so—for optimal training and sports performance. Adequate carbohydrate intake remains vital for individuals and athletes seeking to maximize the benefits from training and performance in sports (Kerksick et al., 2018). Fitness professionals may wish to highlight this to clients who are seeking to implement a rigorous training program for muscle building or performance but are limiting carbohydrates in their diet. Reinforcing the importance of both adequate carbohydrates and proteins in the diet, as well as other nutrients, may help clients optimize their results from training.

Carbohydrates are generally categorized into one of the following groups:

	- Simple sugars

	- Complex carbohydrates

	- Glycogen

	- Fiber

## Structure of Carbohydrates

**Simple sugars**, which most people associate with the word sugar, are comprised of **monosaccharides** (single sugar) and **disaccharides** (two sugars). Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates: single units of sugar. They consist of glucose, fructose, and galactose (**Table 9-7**).

**TABLE 9-7 Monosaccharides**

| Monosaccharides | Found In |
|---|---|
| Glucose | Fruit, simple syrup |
| Fructose | Fruit, part of table sugar (sucrose) |
| Galactose | Milk/dairy |

## Key Terms

**Carbohydrates**
Compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen molecules that include simple sugars, complex carbohydrates, glycogen, and fiber.

**Simple sugars**
Include the monosaccharides and disaccharides; easily absorbed into the bloodstream.

**Monosaccharides**
Simplest form of carbohydrate; single sugar molecules (e.g., glucose).

**Disaccharides**
Two monosaccharides joined together to form a simple sugar. The three disaccharides of nutritional importance include lactose, sucrose, and maltose.
