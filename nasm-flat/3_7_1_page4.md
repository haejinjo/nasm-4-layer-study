### ANATOMIC LOCATIONS

Anatomic locations describe the relative positioning of segments of the body. Anatomical terms commonly used in the fitness industry include *medial, lateral, contralateral, ipsilateral, anterior, posterior, proximal, distal, inferior*, and* superior* (**Figure 7-3; Table 7-1**). These terms are used to describe where various bodily structures are located in more specific ways than common terms such as *above* and *below* or *front* and *rear*.

**TABLE 7-1 Anatomic Location Definitions and Examples**

| Anatomic Location | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Medial | Relatively closer to the midline of the body | The adductors (inner thigh muscles) attach
to the medial side of the femur (thigh bone). |
| Lateral | Relatively farther away from the midline or
toward the outside of the body | The ears are positioned laterally on the
head. |
| Contralateral | Positioned on the opposite side of the body | The right foot is contralateral to the left hand. |
| Ipsilateral | Positioned on the same side of the body | The right foot is ipsilateral to the right hand. |
| Anterior | Positioned on or toward the front of the
body | The quadriceps are located on the anterior
aspect of the thigh. |
| Posterior | Positioned on or toward the back of the
body | The hamstring complex is located on the
posterior aspect of the thigh. |
| Proximal | Positioned nearest to the center of the body
or other identified reference point | The wrist is more proximal to the elbow than
the fingers. |
| Distal | Positioned farthest from the center of the
body or other identified reference point | The ankle is more distal to the hip than the
knee. |
| Inferior | Positioned below an identified reference
point | The soleus (calf muscle) is inferior to the
hamstring complex. |
| Superior | Positioned above an identified reference point | The pelvis is superior to the tibia (shin bone). |
