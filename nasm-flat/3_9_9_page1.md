# SUMMARY

Nutrition plays an important role in health and exercise. A basic understanding of the subject can help fitness professionals better meet the needs of their clients as they move toward their performance or training goals. It is important, however, to keep scope of practice in mind when discussing nutrition with clients. Providing nutrition counseling, medical nutrition therapy, andÂ specific meal plans are not within the scope of practice of fitness professionals who do not hold other nutrition credentials.
