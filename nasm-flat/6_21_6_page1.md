# Applying the OPT Model

The concepts of program design, periodization, and the OPT model have all been described. Program design was defined as creating a purposeful system or plan to achieve a goal. Periodization is the scientific basis that allows fitness professionals to strategically plan and design programs to produce optimal adaptation while minimizing risk of placing improper and irrecoverable stresses on the body. The OPT model is a proven, easy-to-use system of periodization that can be used to create programs for clients with various goals and abilities. Although the understanding of these concepts is paramount, what matters most is the ability to apply the information in multiple situations with a variety of clients. This section will demonstrate how to specifically apply the OPT model for the goals of fat loss, increased lean body mass, and general sports performance. Refer to Appendix B for sample programs for the goals of body fat reduction, lean body mass gain, and general performance.

## Applying the OPT Model for the Goal  ofÂ Body Fat Reduction

The goal of reducing body fat requires clients to expend more calories than they consume. The best way to increase the calories burned is to move more through structured exercise and daily physical activity. Resistance training provides an extremely potent stimulus to burn calories by maintaining, or even increasing, lean muscle tissue. More activity and greater amounts of lean body mass result in more calories expended during exercise and throughout the day. Resistance training also provides the added benefit of increased muscle strength.

The following program is a general representation of how the OPT model can be used for clients with the goal of body fat reduction. **Figure 21-1: 3** shows a sample annual plan. Because the goal does not include maximal strength or power, the client only needs to be cycled through the first three phases of the OPT model. The client will start in January in Phase 1 to ensure proper muscle balance and endurance of the stabilization muscles. They will remain there for approximately 4 weeks before moving on to Phase 2 in February and then Phase 3 in March. This pattern will continue through the month of June. From July through December, the client will perform undulating periodization in which all three phases are performed concurrently each month to minimize boredom and continually improve on all three adaptations (stabilization, strength endurance, and muscular hypertrophy) at the same time.
