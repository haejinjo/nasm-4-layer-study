## Content
In the realm of sports conditioning, macrocycles are typically divided into preparatory, competitive, and transition periods (i.e., preseason, in-season, or off-season) that are spread out over a year’s time (**Figure 21: -2**) (Kostiukevych et al., 2019; Nuell et al., 2019).

#### MONTHLY PLAN (MESOCYCLE)

A monthly training plan, or mesocycle, divides a training plan into specified monthly cycles (Aoki et al., 2017; Owen et al., 2017). The monthly plan details the specific days of each workout and the style of training used (**Figure 21: -3**). This enables clients to see their training schedule on a smaller scale, and it provides more detail than the annual plan (macrocycle).

While typically 4 weeks long, it is important to note that mesocycles do not have to be 1 month in duration in all instances. For example, a bodybuilder may follow a 3-week fat-loss mesocycle in preparation for a contest, whereas a baseball pitcher may use a 6-week off-season mesocycle program to build arm strength and increase throwing velocity.

### WEEKLY PLAN (MICROCYCLE)

A weekly plan, or microcycle, details the specific workouts for the week (**Figure 21: -4**). Many clients appreciate this plan the most, but without first developing the annual or monthly training plans, weekly plans can lack purpose, focus, and direction. Microcycles are usually 7 days, but, depending on the client’s schedule, a microcycle could expand to 10 days, if desired (Dolci et al., 2020; Schneider et al., 2019).
