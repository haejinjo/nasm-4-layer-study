# Chronic Lung Disease

Smoking has progressively declined during the last few decades; however, it is still one of the leading preventable causes of death and a primary risk factor for the development of chronic lung diseases. Chronic lung disease is largely broken into two major categories: obstructive and restrictive. In **restrictive lung disease **or disorders, lung tissue may be fibrotic and, thus, dysfunctional—as in the case of pulmonary fibrosis or asbestosis. In restrictive lung disease, the ability to expand the lungs may be decreased as a result of any number of causes, such as fractured ribs, a neuromuscular disease, or even obesity. In **chronic obstructive lung disease**, the lung tissue may be normal, but airflow is restricted. The major obstructive lung diseases include asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. These diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation (caused primarily by smoking, although asthma may be caused by environmental irritants) and airway obstruction due to mucus production. Fitness professionals might encounter clients with cystic fibrosis. While cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the lungs by excessive mucus production, it is not specific to the lungs and is categorized as a genetic disorder.

The impairments during exercise are similar with regard to both restrictive and obstructive lung disease (**Table 23-2: 3**). Problems include decreased ventilation and decreased gas exchange ability that result in decreased aerobic capacity and endurance and in oxygen desaturation. Clients with lung disease experience fatigue at low levels of exercise and often have **dyspnea**, or shortness of breath. Those with emphysema are frequently underweight and may exhibit overall muscle wasting with hypertrophied neck muscles, which are excessively used to assist in labored breathing. Those with chronic bronchitis may be the opposite of those with emphysema: overweight and barrel chested.

**TABLE 23-23: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Lung Disease**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Lung disease is frequently associated with other comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease. | Screen for presence of other comorbidities. |
| A decrease in the ability to exchange gas in the lungs may result in oxygen desaturation and marked dyspnea at low workloads. | If possible and properly trained, ascertain the level of oxygen saturation using a pulse oximeter.

Pulse oximetry values should be above 90% and certainly above 85%.

Values below this level are a contraindication to continued exercise, regardless of symptoms. |
| Chronic deconditioning results in low aerobic fitness and decreased muscular performance. | The aerobic exercise program should be guided by the client’s shortness of breath.

Workloads of 40–60% of peak work capacity, 3–5 days per week, 20–45 minutes as tolerable; may be achievable.

Intermittent exercise with frequent rest breaks may be necessary to achieve sufficient overall exercise duration. |
| Upper-extremity exercise may result in earlier onset of dyspnea and fatigue than expected, when compared with lower-extremity exercise. | Upper-extremity exercise should be programmed carefully and modified, based on fatigue.

Resistance training can be helpful; use conservative guidelines.

Circuit training in a PHA format is recommended (8–10 exercises, 1 set of 8–15 reps per exercise), emphasizing breathing control and rest as needed between sets. |
| Clients may have significant muscle wasting and be of low body weight (with a BMI < 18). | If the client is very thin, be certain to recommend adequate caloric intake to offset exercise effects. |
| Clients may be using supplemental oxygen. | Fitness professionals may not adjust oxygen flow during exercise; it is considered a medication.

If a client experiences unusual dyspnea or has evidence of oxygen desaturation during exercise, stop exercise and consult with the client’s physician.

Many of these individuals will have rescue or other therapeutic inhalers.

Fitness professionals should ask their clients what medications they currently use and which ones must be kept with them at all times. |

## Key Terms

**Restrictive lung disease**
The condition of a fibrous lung tissue, which results in a decreased ability to expand the lungs.

**Chronic obstructive lung disease**
The condition of altered airflow through the lungs, generally caused by airway obstruction as a result of mucus production.

**Dyspnea**
Shortness of breath or labored breathing.
