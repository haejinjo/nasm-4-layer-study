Even if a fitness professional has the goal of starting a business or opening a fitness studio, beginning a fitness career by working as an employee at a commercial health club could help establish the foundational skills necessary for long-term success. Even when working in a health club or studio as a direct employee, a fitness professional is essentially running their own business when serving the members of that facility, because the fitness professional’s own expertise and commitment to providing a quality service is on display, which directly impacts the fitness professional’s reputation and personal brand. A fitness professional who begins a career working for an employer will learn important business and customer service skills that will be useful if they do eventually make the decision to start a business.

### COMMERCIAL HEALTH CLUBS

As of 2019, the global health club industry is reported to include more than 210,000 facilities serving more than 180 million members (International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, 2019). The goal of the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, which actively promotes the health club industry, is to have more than 230 million health club members worldwide by the year 2030, creating a tremendous amount of employment opportunities for fitness professionals. In short, more health club members create a demand for more Certified Personal Trainers. As a result, the decision to work in a health club could establish the foundation for a financially and personally rewarding career.

Health clubs can be local, regional, national, or even international with locations in multiple countries. Additionally, commercial health clubs can be operated within a corporate structure where a central office oversees operations or as individual franchise affiliates where each location is owned independently (**Table 2-1**). This is important to consider, because a franchise with a local owner will probably be operated differently than a large, publicly traded chain of health clubs. Even if the goal is to one day open a private facility, it is a good idea for fitness professionals to begin their careers in a commercial facility, because it is essentially on-the-job training for operating a fitness business.

**TABLE 2-1 Types of Health Clubs**

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Low-cost | In recent years, these types of health clubs have exploded in popularity. These facilities offer a low-price membership, often including very few amenities other than access to exercise equipment. Access to amenities or programs, such as group fitness classes, small group workout programs, or personal training, costs extra, if the services are offered at all. Additionally, many low-cost clubs will have 24/7 key card access for members instead of employing a front-desk staff. |
| Mid-market | Health clubs in this category provide all features of low-cost clubs with additional amenities like higher-end locker rooms, snack and supplement sales, and group fitness workouts included in the price of membership. In addition, these health clubs often have multiple locations that can be accessed with the same level of membership. |
| Premium | Health clubs in this category typically feature multiple group-fitness studio options like indoor cycling, mind–body, and traditional group fitness programs. They also frequently provide a selection of high-end amenities like towels and complimentary personal hygiene products, cafes to provide postworkout nutrition, pools, full-service spas and salons, sports courts, and in-house childcare services. The price point for a membership at premium clubs varies considerably based on location, the company, and the level of desired facility access. Oftentimes, these clubs sell family packages to help keep things more affordable. |
| Nonprofit | Many nonprofit organizations, such as the YMCA, operate fitness facilities. They then use the revenue from the fitness programs and memberships to cover operational costs, improve the facilities, and fund a wide range of community-based initiatives. However, the term nonprofit can be slightly misleading; while these organizations may not generate profits for a private owner or corporation, they still require fitness professionals to generate revenue no differently than they do at for-profit clubs. |
