### VERTEBRAL COLUMN

The **vertebral column** (also called the spinal column) consists of a series of irregularly shaped bones called vertebrae that house and protect the bundle of nerves known as the **spinal cord** that, in conjunction with the brain, makes up the CNS (**Figure 5-22**) (Bican et al., 2013).

**Figure 5-22The spine

These bones are divided into five different categories depending on where they are located in the spine (**Table 5-2**) (Hamill et al., 2015).

**TABLE 5-2 Segments of the Vertebral Column**

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| Cervical spine (C1–C7) | First seven vertebrae starting at the top of the spinal column
	Form a flexible framework and provide support and motion for the head |
| Thoracic spine (T1–T12) | Twelve vertebrae located in the upper and middle back behind the ribs
	Each vertebra articulates with a rib helping form the rear anchor of the rib cage
	Larger than cervical vertebrae and increase in size from top to bottom |
| Lumbar spine (L1–L5) | Five vertebrae of the low-back below the thoracic spine
	Largest segments in the spinal column
	Support most of the body’s weight and are attached to many back muscles |
| Sacrum | Triangular bone located below the lumbar spine
	Composed of five vertebrae that fuse together as the body develops into adulthood |
| Coccyx | Located below the sacrum, more commonly known as the tailbone
	Composed of three to five small fused bones |

## Key Terms

**Vertebral column**
Bones that house the spinal cord; consists of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions.

**Spinal cord**
Bundle of nerves housed within the vertebrae.
