## Content
## Vertical Loading and Horizontal Loading

**Vertical loading** is a resistance training system that moves a workout vertically down the workout template by alternating body parts trained from set to set (**Table 20-8**). It is a form of training in which strength-training exercises are performed in rapid succession, starting with the upper body and working down to the lower body:

	- Total-body

	- Chest

	- Back

	- Shoulders

	- Biceps Triceps

	- Legs

**TABLE 20-8 Vertical Loading**

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Tempo | Rest | Coaching Tip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total body | ↓ |  |  |  | Complete exercises for each body part before beginning the next set |
| Chest | ↓ |  |  |  |  |
| Back | ↓ |  |  |  |  |
| Shoulders | ↓ |  |  |  |  |
| Biceps | ↓ |  |  |  |  |
| Triceps | ↓ |  |  |  |  |
| Legs | ↓ |  |  |  |  |

In a vertically loaded workout, the client would perform the first exercise (total-body) for the required repetitions and then move on to the chest exercise for the next set of repetitions. After the chest exercise, the client would move on to the back exercise and so forth, until all exercises have been completed. Once completed, the client would return to the first total-body exercise and run through the exercises again for the desired amount of sets. This can also be done in a circuit style, by minimizing the rest periods between exercises.

This vertical loading system of training can be very beneficial for allowing maximal recovery to each body part while minimizing the amount of time wasted on rest. For example, if it takes 1 minute to perform each exercise, by the time the client returns to the chest exercise, 7 to 10 minutes could have passed, which should be sufficient time to allow for adequate recovery. Even though 7 to 10 minutes have passed, the client has been constantly moving and has performed one set of every exercise in their workout.
