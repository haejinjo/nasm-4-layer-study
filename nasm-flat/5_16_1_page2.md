# Introduction to Core Training

Core training is critical for improving posture (Ko & Kang, 2017; Park et al., 2016), enhancing performance (Butcher et al., 2007; Dello Iacono et al., 2016; Shinkle et al., 2012), increasing resistance to injury (Huxel Bliven & Anderson, 2013), and accelerating injury rehabilitation (Coulombe et al., 2017). A properly designed core training program can be a key component of an overall training plan used to achieve a broad range of goals. The objective of core training is the development of **core stability**, endurance, strength, and power. Core stability and **core endurance** refer to the ability of an individual to maintain proper spinal and hip posture while the extremities (i.e., arms and legs) are moving. **Core strength** refers to the ability to contract the torso in all directions (i.e., flexion, extension, rotation), and core power involves explosive movements of the core musculature. There are multiple muscle groups that make up the core region, which are commonly characterized as local or global musculature. To properly stabilize and strengthen the core, both local and global core muscles must work together. This chapter discusses the importance of core training and how to design and incorporate core training into a clientâ€™s overall training program. Future chapters discuss balance and plyometric training and how these additional methods can be incorporated into a training program that will enhance overall functional efficiency.

## Key Terms

**Core stability**
The ability of an individual to maintain a given position, adequately stabilizing the spine while the extremities are moving.

**Core endurance**
The ability to control the motion of the spine over a given longer duration.

**Core strength**
The ability to control the motion of the spine.
