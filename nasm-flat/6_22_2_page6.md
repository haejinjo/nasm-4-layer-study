## Content
In an ideal training environment, maximal movement velocity should be attained to increase power capabilities, particularly for sports performance (Hermassi et al., 2015; Ignjatovic et al., 2012). The medicine ball is a very useful modality because it allows movements to occur as explosively as possible without the need for eccentric deceleration. For example, when performing a kneeling medicine ball chest pass, a client can release the medicine ball at the end of the movement, thus allowing for full concentric power development (**Figure 22-1: 2**). Most free-weight exercises performed in an explosive fashion, such as a speed bench press, require the individual to decelerate the load near the end of the movement to avoid throwing the weight through the air. This does not allow for full expression of power through the entire range of motion. Explosive medicine ball movements in conjunction with resistance training have been found effective in improving movement velocity and other factors influencing sports performance (Fletcher & Hartwell, 2004; Ignjatovic et al., 2012; Szymanski et al., 2007).

When using medicine balls for their explosive power capabilities, it is important to assess their intended use and choose one that safely and effectively accomplishes the desired goal. Medicine balls can be made of hard rubber, leather, or other leather-like materials. They often weigh between 1 lb and 30 lb (0.4–14 kg). High-velocity movements will require a lighter ball, generally less than 10% of an individual’s body weight. Rubber medicine balls are best used for rebounding activities, such as bouncing or throwing the ball against a wall. It is important for fitness professionals to assess their client, training environment, and their own level of expertise with medicine ball training before implementing programs in which medicine balls are thrown and caught.
