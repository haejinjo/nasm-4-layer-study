## Monitoring Exercise

Fitness professionals should closely monitor their clients during an exercise session, including monitoring exercise intensity and exercise technique. Monitoring exercise intensity can be performed in many fashions, such as tracking heart rate or ratings of perceived exertion, which is a subjective ratings scale from 1 to 10 in which clients subjectively rate their level of effort during exercise based on physical markers, such as breathlessness, fatigue, sweat rate, and muscle soreness (Muyor, 2013) (**Table 20-10**). A lower score indicates light effort, whereas scores closer to 10 indicate intense effort.

**TABLE 20-10 Rating of Perceived Exertion**

| Rating | Perceived Exertion Level |
|---|---|
| 0 | No exertion, at rest |
| 1 | Very light |
| 2–3 | Light |
| 4–5 | Moderate, somewhat hard |
| 6–7 | High, vigorous |
| 8–9 | Very hard |
| 10 | Maximum effort, highest possible |

### FIVE KINETIC CHAIN CHECKPOINTS

In addition to tracking exercise intensity, fitness professionals must be proficient at teaching and correcting proper exercise technique. In other words, fitness professionals must be diligent and meticulous when monitoring their client’s movements and provide the appropriate corrections and cueing to ensure that their clients perform exercises correctly. This minimizes injury risk and maximizes muscle recruitment. As with all exercises, quality should always come before quantity or weight progression, and the five kinetic chain checkpoints should always be monitored (**Figure 20-8**).

	- **Feet**: Approximately shoulder-width apart and pointing straight ahead (unless the exercise requires a different foot position)

	- **Knees**: In line with the second and third toes (avoid allowing knees to cave inward)

	- **Hips**: Level and in a neutral position

	- **Shoulders**: In a neutral position (avoid protracting or elevating the shoulders, unless the exercise requires these positions)

	- **Head**: Cervical spine in a neutral position
