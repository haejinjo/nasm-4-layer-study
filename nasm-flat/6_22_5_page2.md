## Content
Proper use of stability balls allows for the increase in strength and stability of the core musculature when substituted for more stable surfaces, such as exercise benches, chairs, and the floor (Behm & Colado, 2012; Carter et al., 2006; Stanton et al., 2004; Sternlich et al., 2007; Willardson, 2004). The spherical shape of the ball creates an unstable base of support, forcing users to constantly adjust their body position to the subtle movements of the ball. The most popular use of stability balls involves using it in place of traditional benches during the performance of a variety of prone (**Figure 22-2: 4**) and supine exercises (**Figure 22-2: 5**) using light loads or body weight. However, stability balls can be dangerous if one does not possess good balance or control, so it is important to evaluate the risk versus reward for the individual involved and follow all safety guidelines (**Table 22: -4**). Standing on a stability ball is never recommended.

**TABLE 22-4: Stability Ball Safety Guidelines**

| Inspection Process Before Use | Inspect stability ball for any damage, tears, worn spots, etc. |
|---|---|
| Make sure the stability ball is fully inflated (should feel firm). |
| Opt for a burst-resistant stability ball. |
| Inspect and do not exceed suggested weight capacity. |
| Proper Use of Stability Ball | Only use a stability ball in an open space away from exercise machines, furniture, or other equipment. |
| Keep the ball away from direct heat sources, such as prolonged sun exposure, heaters, and fireplaces. |
| Do not wear sharp objects that could puncture the ball, such as jewelry. |
| Do not perform any standing exercises on the stability ball. |
| For first-time users, fitness professionals may need to hold the ball for added stability to ensure proper exercise technique and relieve user apprehension of falling. |
| Children should only use a stability ball with proper adult supervision. |
| Maintain proper posture using the five kinetic chain checkpoints during all exercises. |
| Do not perform near maximal or maximal lifts on the stability ball. |
