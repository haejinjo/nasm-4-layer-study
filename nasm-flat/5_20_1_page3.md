## Principle of Adaptation

One of the more unique features and traits of the human body is its ability to adapt under various conditions, including stress, environmental changes, and functional capacities. Resistance training also elicits physical adaptations (**Figure 20-1**). Regardless of the primary goal of the client, whether it is related to aesthetics or sports performance, resistance training has been shown to exhibit significant favorable outcomes (Duchateau et al., 2006; Gabriel et al., 2006) **Table 20-1**.

**TABLE 20-1 Adaptive Benefits of Resistance Training**

| Physical and Performance Benefits |
|---|
| Improved cardiovascular efficiency
	Improved endocrine (hormone) and cholesterol adaptations
	Increased muscular hypertrophy (larger muscles)
	Increased bone density
	Increased metabolism
	Decreased body fat | Increased neuromuscular control (coordination)
	Increased connective tissue (tendons, ligaments) strength
	Increased muscular endurance
	Increased muscular strength
	Increased power |

## General Adaptation Syndrome

The **general adaptation syndrome (GAS)** is the central theory governing overall adaptation to training responses. GAS was first proposed in 1936 by Hans Selye, a Canadian physician. It is used to describe the process of how an organism adapts when it is exposed to an acute, orÂ even damaging stimulus (Selye, 1936).

## Key Terms

**General adaptation syndrome (GAS)**
Describes the way in which the body responds and adapts to stress.
