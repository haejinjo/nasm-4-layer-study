## Content
While the spine may exhibit small deviations from midline in the frontal plane, large curvatures of the spine away from midline are considered abnormal and may be classified as **scoliosis** (**Figure 16-6**). While scoliosis can often result from altered bone shape through the spine (structural scoliosis), functional scoliosis (nonstructural scoliosis) can be influenced by muscle imbalances, particularly muscle imbalances between right and left sides of the body. This leads to altered alignment of the spine in the frontal plane (Hawes, 2003; Zapata et al., 2015). Core muscle strengthening has been found to improve spinal alignment in individuals with functional scoliosis (Ko & Kang, 2017; Park et al., 2016).

## Key Terms

**Scoliosis**
An abnormal curve of the spine from side to side.
