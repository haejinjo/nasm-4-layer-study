## Content
Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in children, teenagers, or young adults. With type 1 diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells stop producing insulin, causing blood sugar levels to rise, resulting in **hyperglycemia **(high levels of blood sugar). To control this hyperglycemia, the individual with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin to compensate for what the pancreas cannot produce. Exercise increases the rate at which cells use glucose, which may mean that insulin levels may need to be adjusted with exercise. If the individual with type 1 diabetes does not control their blood glucose levels before, during, and after exercise, blood sugar levels can drop rapidly and cause a condition called **hypoglycemia **(low blood sugar), leading to weakness, dizziness, and fainting. Although insulin, proper diet, and exercise are the primary components prescribed for individuals with type 1 diabetes, these individuals must still be monitored throughout exercise to ensure safety.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with obesity, particularly abdominal obesity (Caspard et al., 2017). The incidence and prevalence of adult type 2 diabetes across the globe has increased sharply in recent years. There is a significant public health concern about the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in children, associated with both the increase in abdominal obesity and decrease in voluntary physical activity. Individuals with type 2 diabetes usually produce adequate amounts of insulin; however, their cells are resistant to the insulin, meaning that the insulin present cannot transfer adequate amounts of blood sugar into the cell. This condition can lead to hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia is linked with a number of diseases associated with damage to the kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes, and circulatory system. Although individuals with type 2 diabetes do not experience the same fluctuations in blood sugar as those with type 1, it is still important to be aware of the symptoms, particularly for individuals with type 2 diabetes who use insulin medications.

## Exercise and Diabetes

The most important goal of exercise for individuals with either type of diabetes is glucose control, and for those with type 2 diabetes, weight loss and energy expenditure. Exercise training is effective for both goals because it has a similar action to insulin, enhancing the uptake of circulating glucose by exercising skeletal muscle. Research has shown that exercise improves a variety of glucose measures, including tissue sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and insulin requirements (Moore et al., 2016; Thent et al., 2013). Thus, exercise has been shown to have a substantial positive effect on the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Specific exercise guidelines and recommendations can be followed when working with a diabetic population, including strategies to prevent hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events during or after exercise as well as when to defer exercise based on resting blood glucose levels or symptoms. In most cases, excluding other health-related problems, the exercise management goals for individuals with diabetes are similar to those for physical inactivity and excess body weight. In contrast to walking being a highly preferred form of exercise for obese clients, care must be taken when recommending walking to clients with diabetes to prevent blisters and foot microtrauma that could result in foot infection. Special care should also be taken with respect to giving advice to clients with diabetes regarding carbohydrate intake and insulin use, not only before exercise but also afterward, to reduce the risk of a hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event.
