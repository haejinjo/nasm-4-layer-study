## Content
Exercise guidelines for clients with diabetes are similar to those advised for obese adults, as many clients with type 2 diabetes are obese. In such cases, daily exercise is recommended for more stable glucose management and maximal caloric expenditure (**Tables 23-8 **and **23-9**). Low-impact exercise activities can reduce the risk of injury, whereas resistance training is advised as part of an overall exercise plan for health and fitness.

**TABLE 23-8: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Diabetes**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness | Considerations in Sport and Athletic Training |
|---|---|---|
| Frequently associated with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and hypertension) | Type 2 diabetes exercise program should target a weekly caloric goal of expending 1,000–2,000 kcal, progressing as tolerable, to maximize weight loss and cardio protection. | Screening for comorbidities (presence of two chronic diseases) is important. |
| Exercise exerts an effect similar to that of insulin. | Physical exertion increases risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia.. | Be aware of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. |
| Hypoglycemia may occur several hours after exercise, as well as during exercise. | For those recently diagnosed, glucose should be measured before, during, and after exercise | Restoration of glucose after the event may be necessary to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. |
