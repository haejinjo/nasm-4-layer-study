**TABLE 23-8: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Diabetes (continued)**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness | Considerations in Sport and Athletic Training |
|---|---|---|
| Clients taking beta-blocking medications may be unable to recognize signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. | Some reduction in insulin and increase in carbohydrate intake may be necessary and proportionate to exercise intensity and duration. | Substantial insulin dose reduction may be necessary before exercise.

Carbohydrate intake before and during exercise may be necessary. |
| Exercise in excessive heat may mask signs of hypoglycemia. | Postexercise carbohydrate consumption is advisable. | Initial exercise programming should emphasize low intensity, with a progression in exercise duration (up to 60 minutes as tolerable) and frequency (5–7 days per week). for consistent glucose control.

Intensity should be no greater than 50–90% of work capacity to start with. |
| Increased risk for retinopathy (damage to retina of the eyes). | Be cognizant of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. | Resistance training guidelines may follow those for normal-weight, healthy adults. |
| Peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness, or pain usually in the feet or hands) may increase risk for gait abnormalities and infection from foot blisters that may go unnoticed. | Use weight-bearing exercise cautiously and wear appropriate footwear. | Check daily for blisters or skin injury and appropriate footwear. |

**TABLE 23-9: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Individuals with Diabetes**

| Mode | Low-impact activities (such as cycling, treadmill walking, swimming) |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 4–7 days per week |
| Intensity | 50–90% of maximum heart rate

Cardiorespiratory training (may be adjusted to 40–70% of maximal heart rate if needed) |
| Duration | 20–60 minutes |
| Assessment | Pushing assessment

Pulling assessment

Overhead squat (if tolerated) |
| Flexibility | Static, active, or dynamic stretches |
| Resistance Training | 1–3 sets of 10–15 repetitions, 2–3 days per week

Higher repetitions, such as 20, may be used. |
| Special Considerations | Make sure client has appropriate footwear, and have client or physician check feet for blisters or abnormal wear patterns.

Advise client or class participant to keep a snack (quick source of carbohydrate) available during exercise to avoid sudden hypoglycemia.

Avoid excessive plyometric training, and higher-intensity training is not recommended for clients with diabetes.

Self-myofascial techniques may be contraindicated; a physician’s approval is recommended. |
