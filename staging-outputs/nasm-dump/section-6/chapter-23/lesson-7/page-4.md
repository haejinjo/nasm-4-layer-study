**TABLE 23-25: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Intermittent Claudication or PAD (continued)**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Smoking significantly worsens PAD and exercise tolerance. | Strongly recommend smoking cessation. If a client continues to smoke, do not allow smoking for at least 1 hour before exercise. |
| PAD frequently results in decreased aerobic capacity and endurance. | Focus on aerobic exercise activities, with an emphasis on walking. |
| Resistance training may improve overall physical function but may not address limitations of PAD. | Resistance exercise should be complementary to but not substituted for aerobic exercise.

A circuit-training format is recommended (e.g., 8–10 exercises, 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps per exercise, progressing up to 12–20 reps).

An intermittent format of exercise may be necessary, with intensity guided by pain tolerance. Typical guidelines suggest exercise into moderate to severe discomfort, rest until subsided, and repeat until total exercise time is achieved (20–30 minutes).

Always screen for comorbidities. |
