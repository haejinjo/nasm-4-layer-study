## Content
Exercise programs for this population should follow specific guidelines (**Table 23-2: 0**). Assessment procedures for individuals with cancer can follow the guidelines in Chapters 11 and 12.

**TABLE 23-20: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Individuals with Cancer**

| Mode | Treadmill walking, stationary cycling, rowers, low-impact or step aerobics |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 3–5 days per week |
| Intensity | Cardiorespiratory training should start out at a moderate level (40–70% HRmax) and progress as tolerated. |
| Duration | 15–30 minutes per session (may only start with 5 minutes) |
| Assessment | Pushing assessment

Pulling assessment

Overhead squat assessment (if tolerated) |
| Flexibility | Static and active stretching |
| Resistance Training | 1–3 sets of 10–15 repetitions, 2–3 days per week

May use a circuit or PHA training system. |
| Special Considerations | Avoid heavy lifting in initial stages of training.

Allow for adequate rest intervals, and progress client slowly.

There may be a need to start with only 5 minutes of exercise and progressively increase, depending on the severity of conditions and fatigue. |

The specific pushing, pulling, and overhead squat assessments should be representative of the client’s ability level and may need to be omitted. Flexibility should include static and active stretching. Self-myofascial techniques can be used if no complications exist that would prevent its use. Check with a physician if there is any question. Self-myofascial techniques are not recommended for clients receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Cardiorespiratory training for this population is very important but may have to start with 5 minutes of light aerobic exercise, progressing up to 30 minutes, 3 to 5 days per week. Higher-intensity aerobic training may be used if the client’s physician agrees.

Core and balance exercises are essential for this population, as they will help in regaining stabilization necessary for activities of daily living that may have been lost due to the lack of activity caused by treatments. Clients should be progressed slowly and according to their physical ability. Resistance training for this population will include one to three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.
