Degenerative processes associated with aging can lead to a decrease in the functional capacity of older adults, including potentially significant reductions in muscular strength and endurance, range of motion or mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, and <strong><a id="7ea2a713-a492-8ddc-5b97-7424b4482fa1-0" name="7ea2a713-a492-8ddc-5b97-7424b4482fa1-0">proprioception</a> </strong>(Colon-Emeric et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2016). One of the most important and fundamental functional activities affected by degenerative aging is walking. The decreased ability to move freely in one’s own environment not only reduces the physical and emotional independence of an individual but also can lead to an increase in the degenerative cycle (Hertling &amp; Kessler, 2006). The ability or inability to perform normal activities of daily living—such as bathing, eating, housekeeping, and leisure activities—can be measured to help determine the functional status of an individual.</p>

However, research has shown that musculoskeletal degeneration may not be entirely age-related and that certain measures can be taken to prevent loss of muscle strength and functional immobility with aging (Fragala et al., 2019; Hong &amp; Kim, 2018). It has also been demonstrated that many of the structural deficits responsible for decreased functional capacity in older adults, including loss of muscle strength and proprioception, can be slowed and even reversed by participating in routine physical activity and exercise (Giallauria et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016).</p>

Before initiating any exercise training, older adults must complete a <a id="445c77d1-fb29-4fc4-47f2-35757215c881-0" name="445c77d1-fb29-4fc4-47f2-35757215c881-0"><strong>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire Plus (PAR-Q+)</strong></a>. It is also recommended that older adults complete a health history questionnaire and appropriate fitness and movement assessments (discussed in Chapters 11 and 12). Assessments such as those included in the senior fitness test (e.g., sit to stand test, back scratch test, stand up and go) help provide information about an individual’s quality of movement as well as the ability to perform activities of daily living. Fitness professionals interested in working with active older adults should seek out advanced education regarding these assessments.</p>

Self-myofascial techniques, as discussed in Chapter 14, are advised for this population, provided there is sufficient ability and tolerance to perform the necessary movement, and the client does not have varicose veins or other types of contraindications. Static stretching is also advised if well tolerated. Otherwise, simple forms of active or dynamic stretching are recommended to help get the client to start moving their joints during the warm-up period.</p>

However, older adults taking certain prescribed medications and those with other chronic health conditions must be carefully monitored. Exercise training should be progressed slowly—with an emphasis on executing ideal movement patterns and enhancing stabilization using appropriate core, balance, and resistance exercises—before moving on to more advanced forms of exercise. When designing an exercise program for older adults, the fitness professional must take specialized care in ensuring safety for the participants. The better a fitness professional can match exercises appropriate to the clients’ capabilities, the safer and more effective the program will be. All exercises should be performed with precise technique and control to minimize risk of injury. As always, fitness professionals are encouraged to consult with a licensed physician whenever questions arise regarding older adult clients.</p>
