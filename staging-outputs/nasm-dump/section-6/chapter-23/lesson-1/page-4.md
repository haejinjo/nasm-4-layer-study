Because of their relatively high peak oxygen uptake levels, children can perform endurance activities fairly well. However, children do not tolerate exercise in hot, humid environments because they have higher submaximal oxygen demands and a lower absolute sweating rate when compared with adults. Vigorous exercise in hot, humid environments should be restricted to less than 30 minutes for children, including frequent rest periods. As with adults, adequate hydration before, during, and after exercise is very important for youth. Unlike adults with sustained low-intensity endurance activities, children are at a disadvantage when participating in short-duration (10 to 90 seconds), high-intensity anaerobic activities because they produce less glycolytic enzymes that are required to support sustained anaerobic power.Â For safety and training considerations, children should have planned rest intervals when training at high-intensity levels.

# Resistance Training for Youth

Research has demonstrated that resistance training is both safe and effective in children and adolescents (Lloyd et al., 2014). Resistance training for health and fitness conditioning in youth also results in a lower risk of injury when compared with many popular sports, including soccer, football, and basketball (Faigenbaum & Myer, 2009; U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 2019). The most common injuries associated with resistance training in youth are injury to ligaments (sprains) and injury to tendons or muscles (strains), which are usually attributable to a lack of qualified supervision, poor technique, and improper progression (Lloyd et al., 2014). Injuries can and do occur in youth participating in any activity or sport, including resistance training; however, no injuries have ever been reported in well-designed scientific studies looking at the effect of resistance training in youth (Lloyd et al., 2014).
