## Elastic Resistance

Elastic resistance training is an inexpensive alternative to free weights or machines. Various forms of elastic resistance training can be used to help improve coordination, muscular endurance, and joint stabilization. Elastic resistance training may not be ideal for improving maximal strength or muscular hypertrophy, but it has been shown to be very beneficial to help improve muscular strength and endurance for fitness and rehabilitative purposes (Andersen et al., 2010; Colado et al., 2010).

Elastic resistance training techniques allow clients to move in multiple planes of motion and oftentimes achieve a greater ROM during training than using selectorized strength-training machines. Clients can also adjust the line of pull by moving the fixed point higher or lower and combine several exercises seamlessly. Elastic bands and tubing also allow clients to perform resistance exercises that mimic sport-specific movements, such as a golf swing or tennis forehand.
