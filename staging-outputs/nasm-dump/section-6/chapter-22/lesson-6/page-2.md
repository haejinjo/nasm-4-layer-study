There are many benefits to using a fitness tracker; however, motivation, accountability, accuracy, and medical purposes seem to be the primary reasons why people decide to purchase these devices.

### MOTIVATION

	- Many fitness trackers are equipped with personalized program reminders, such as calendars, alarms, or daily motivational messages, that are designed to constantly remind the user of their goals. This can be especially powerful for those who exercise alone.

	- Some research suggests that approximately 50% of those who begin a fitness program will quit within the first 6 months (Henriksen et al., 2018). Wearing a fitness tracker may encourage an increase in physical activities.

	- The ability to store and record workouts and activities seems to positively affect users and, in some cases, may negatively affect them, if they don’t like the effort they’re putting forth.

	- Fitness trackers provide the user conformational feedback. Physical results, such as weight or inches lost, may not be noticeable to the individual on a daily basis. However, the tracking device can provide a monitored record of effort for the user to enhance motivation.

### ACCOUNTABILITY

	- In some instances, an individual may be part of a group (e.g., weight-loss group) and the fitness tracker provides a way to ensure each member is holding up to their commitment to the team. Members of the team can compare and track their results and help hold each other accountable.

### ACCURACY

	- Unfortunately, fitness trackers are not 100% accurate, and this level of accuracy varies across makes and models. Regardless, fitness trackers still provide a good estimate of a person’s activity level and act as a helpful tool to set goals and track results.

### MEDICAL PURPOSES

	- For those individuals with medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, fitness trackers can serve as a helpful reminder tool when to take medications, when to eat, or even when to exercise.

	- Tracking a patient’s personal history can be very advantageous to physicians when treating certain diseases. In some instances, using a fitness tracker may be lifesaving.

## Fitness and Nutrition Apps

With smartphone technology, the ability to monitor our nutritional habits as well as access fitness programming is literally at one’s fingertips. The variety and ease of use of these applications (apps) has given people the ability to take command of their nutrition and fitness goals. Nutrition and fitness apps provide a road map to obtaining one’s health objectives much easier than in the past. The advent of fitness and nutrition apps provides users with personalized programming designed to help them achieve their health and fitness goals.

### NUTRITIONAL APPS

While tracking nutritional intake has numerous benefits, many of the new apps do much more than simply count calories.
