It is the responsibility of the fitness professional to evaluate their client’s physical capabilities before introducing a new exercise modality or advanced forms of exercise. There are certain instances where the risk can outweigh the rewards:

	- **Never compromise form over function.**

		- Regardless of the modality, sacrificing proper exercise technique is never recommended. Fitness professionals should only introduce new modalities or advanced forms of exercise after clients have exhibited competency in basic movement patterns.

	- **Always use caution when training on an unstable surface.**

		- Balance exercises are an integral part of the Optimum Performance Training® (OPT™) model and should be introduced by Certified Personal Trainers to their clients. However, fitness professionals should take a slow and measured approach using balance modalities that are appropriate based on the client’s functional capabilities and goals. For example, lifting heavy weights as one tries to balance on a balance training device can be extremely dangerous and is not recommended. Balance exercises and modalities have been shown to improve balance, ankle stability, and coordination but, for safety reasons, should not be used to perform maximal or near maximal lifts (Brachman et al., 2017; Linens et al., 2016; Wortmann & Docherty, 2013). While there is an increase in the recruitment of stabilizing muscles of the joints and the core musculature, research has shown there are limited prime mover strength benefits to be found when lifting from an unstable surface (Cressey et al., 2007). Consequently, balance modalities should be reserved to improve balance, coordination, and joint stability rather than aiming to increase maximal strength or power.

	- **Recognize limitations of fitness apps.**

		- Fitness apps are downloadable applications that can be used with most smartphones and are designed to help users obtain certain fitness goals. However, fitness trackers are not always 100% accurate (Evenson et al., 2015). This could lead to miscalculations of actual exercise effort and output and potentially lead to overexertion. Some fitness apps contain content that can be contraindicated for some individuals, especially if the client has suffered a past injury or is dealing with a chronic condition. Caution needs to be addressed so that gimmicky or dangerous movements are not attempted.

## Strength-Training Machines

Selectorized strength-training machines are popular in fitness facilities and are often a good resistance training method for new clients. Most strength-training machines are relatively easy to use, accompanied by instructional diagrams or pictures, and often less intimidating than dumbbells or barbells. Because most novice exercisers lack resistance training experience, strength-training machines may offer a safer and effective alternative to free weights. Machines tend to keep the individual in a fixed plane of motion, which limits excessive ranges of motion that may result in unnecessary musculoskeletal stress. Strength-training machines may also be the strength modality of choice for those who lack stability or have other functional limitations. Another advantage of most strength-training machines is that they offer the client the ability to change the load rather quickly with a simple pull of a pin or turn of the dial.
