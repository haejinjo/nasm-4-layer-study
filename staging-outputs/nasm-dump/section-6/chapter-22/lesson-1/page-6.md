**TABLE 22-2: Pros and Cons of Free Weights**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Can be used to emphasize certain muscle groups or target multiple muscle groups | May require a spotter |
| Can improve athletic performance | May be too difficult for beginning clients to perform until exercise technique is mastered |
| Can challenge the core stabilization system | Requires multiple dumbbells or barbells to change intensity (load) |
| May improve dynamic joint stabilization and proprioception | Potentially more dangerous |
| Allows individuals to move in multiple planes of motion | Intimidating for certain individuals |

The pros and cons of free weights are illustrated inÂ **Table 22: -2**. Because free weights can be used in a variety of fashions, for many goals, and by virtually all populations, they can be effectively used in all phases of the OPT model.

## Cable Machines

Cable machines offer a variety of fitness and sports performance benefits in that they allow similar freedom of movement as free weights yet provide similar security as strength training machines because they do not require a spotter. Cable machines can be adapted to offer resistance for all body parts and are effective for developing stability, muscular endurance, hypertrophy (increased muscle size), strength, and power. Studies have also shown that cable machines can provide greater ranges of motion when compared to selectorized strength equipment (Signorile et al., 2017). Cable machines are also an excellent option to challenge the core while having individuals perform exercises in a standing position versus seated as seen in many machine exercises, and they have proven beneficial for older adults (Balachandran et al., 2016).

When using a cable machine, it is important to align the angle of resistance (line of pull) of the cable with the line of pull of the muscle being worked. Remember that joint motion is caused by muscles pulling on bones; muscles cannot actively push.
