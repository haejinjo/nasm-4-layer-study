## Content
Because ofÂ the stabilization requirements of the mode of training, suspended bodyweight exercises are ideal in Phases 1 and 2 of the OPT model, but they can be integrated in all phases, especially during core and balance training. For example, in Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training, a client may use suspended push-ups as a chest exercise (**Figure 22-1: 9**). In Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training, clients may superset this same exercise after performing a barbell bench press (**Figure 22-2: 0**).
