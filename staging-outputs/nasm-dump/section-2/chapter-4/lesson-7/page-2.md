#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

	- Clients expect professionalism; thus, it is crucial to build relationships and maintain a facility that supports training competency.

	- Program designs should be based on the clients’ abilities and should address their health concerns and goals.

	- Self-efficacy is one of the strongest determinants of physical activity in adults; most coaching efforts are directed at increasing a person’s self-efficacy.

	- Planning and self-monitoring are essential techniques in developing a self-regulatory strategy to improve self-efficacy.

	- Affective judgments and subjective norms can impact a person’s readiness to perform resistance training.

	- Certified Personal Trainers should assess a client’s stage of change and promote competency in exercise.

	- The stages of change include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.

	- Both verbal and nonverbal forms of communication are important for developing professional client relationships.

	- Active listening refers to having a genuine interest in understanding the client’s health and fitness goals. It involves asking appropriate questions, avoiding distractions and inner dialogue, and providing appropriate feedback.

	- Motivational interviewing is a style of coaching that is used to enhance intrinsic motivation for change. Certified Personal Trainers can use some techniques from motivational interviewing, such as developing a discrepancy between a client’s current state and ideal state, promoting change talk, and assessing readiness, willingness, and perceived ability to change.

	- BCTs are used to enhance the determinants of behavior. Certified Personal Trainers may use any number of strategies to enhance a client’s confidence, motivation, or self-regulation skills through planning, self-monitoring, and goal setting.

	- Cognitive strategies that can help change behaviors include positive self-talk, imagery, and the practice of psyching up before activity.

	- Goals that clients set should be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. Clients should also focus on both process goals and outcome goals.

	- For the best outcomes, clients should determine long-term bigger goals, then develop a series of smaller goals that help drive progress to the main goal.
