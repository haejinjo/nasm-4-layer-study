## Content
Therefore, while many determinants are shared with exercise and physical activity, it is useful to address resistance training on its own.

There is evidence to support the relationships between resistance training participation and **affective judgment**, self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control, self-regulatory behaviors, and intention (Bryan & Rocheleau, 2002; Gao & Kosma, 2008). In other words, people tend to engage in resistance training when they think it feels good, believe they can do the exercises correctly and overcome barriers, can self-monitor and makes plans, and have high levels of motivation. Intention is a direct predictor of behavior, but planning has also been shown to help translate intentions and self-efficacy to behavior (Lubans et al., 2012; Paech & Lippke, 2017). **Subjective norms** also have a small, positive relationship with resistance training (Rhodes et al., 2017).
