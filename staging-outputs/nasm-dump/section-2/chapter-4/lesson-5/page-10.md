## Content
**Technique imagery** involves focusing on exercise technique (Giacobbi et al., 2003; Kossert & Munroe-Chandler, 2007). Clients may also use imagery to concentrate, to enhance confidence, and to regulate effort (Kossert & Munroe-Chandler, 2007). Once the fitness professional has worked with a client to develop a positive, successful piece of imagery, the best times to use it should be identified. Clients can use imagery at any time, but it is particularly effective during a time when they may not be feeling motivated or positive about exercising.

### PSYCHING UP

For someone new to exercise, motivation can be challenging. The technique of **psyching up** is used to help clients feel excited, positive, engaged, and energetic before exercise. Fitness professionals can give clients the knowledge and skills to develop the necessary positive energy to exercise. Psyching up develops the internal dialogue clients already use to get excited and motivated for other situations in their lives

For example, clients may have certain types of music that excite them and get them into a positive and energetic place. Consequently, listening to that type of music before and during exercise can help clients get the most out of a session. Other examples that may psych up a client can include watching motivational videos, dancing, or implementing a specialized warm-up routine. Fitness professionals should continue having conversations with clients about those things that are most effective at making them feel psyched up. This is important to ensure that they will adhere to an exercise program.
