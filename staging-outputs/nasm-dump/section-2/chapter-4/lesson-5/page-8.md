## Content
It is important for clients to find effective, individual methods of self-monitoring, such as journaling, making notes on a calendar, or using a fitness tracker app on their mobile device. Beyond recording the traditional sets, repetitions, weights, and exercise durations, it is also suggested that clients include when they exercised, the events that occurred before they exercised, how they felt before and after they exercised, and which exercises they enjoyed. Self-monitoring logs provide the client with several benefits, including the following:

	- Opportunity to observe progress over time, which can enhance confidence

	- Accountability if the client knows that the fitness professional is going to ask to see the log

	- Awareness of precursors to behavior, which can serve to identify barriers or facilitators of exercise

Fitness professionals can also provide some time management techniques for clients. Time management is another BCT that has had positive effects on physical activity by teaching people how to better manage their time (Williams & French, 2011). Some common time management strategies include the following:

	- Assigning priorities to daily tasks and completing the more important ones first

	- Not accepting every request for one’s time; keeping hours open for unexpected events and personal needs

	- Turning key tasks into repetitive habits

	- Scheduling buffer time between important tasks

	- Implementing systems of organization

	- Eliminating nonessential tasks

	- Limiting time spent on empty activities like scrolling through social media feeds

## Cognitive Strategies

Cognitive strategies are used to change a client’s thoughts and attitudes toward exercise and physical activity. They are intended to alter the way someone thinks about an activity to increase motivation, adherence, and sometimes even performance. These strategies include positive selftalk, psyching up, and the use of mental imagery.

### POSITIVE SELF-TALK

For someone new to exercise, there may be a lot of negativity and negative thoughts toward exercise. Some of those thoughts include, I can’t do this, It’s too hard, It takes too much time, or It’s too painful. Certified Personal Trainers can do two specific things to help clients overcome their negativity. The first is to help them develop positive self-talk. Positive **self-talk** is a form of encouraging and motivating internal dialogue that increases self-efficacy.

## Key Terms

**Self-talk**
Internal dialogue in which the individual interprets feelings and perceptions, regulates and changes evaluations and convictions, and gives himself or herself instructions and reinforcement.
