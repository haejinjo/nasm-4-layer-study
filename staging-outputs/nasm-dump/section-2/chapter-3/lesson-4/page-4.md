# CRITICAL

While exercise is known to reduce feelings of depression and anxiety, a fitness professional should never attempt to diagnose any mental illness or prescribe exercise to clients as a form of treatment. Only a licensed medical provider can diagnose illnesses and prescribe treatments. Therefore, if any mental illness is suspected, clients should be referred to their primary care physician for further evaluation.
