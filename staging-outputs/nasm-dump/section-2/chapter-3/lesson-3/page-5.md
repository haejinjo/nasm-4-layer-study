When a client hires a Certified Personal Trainer, there is an expectation that companionship support is built into the experience. Fitness professionals need to stay focused on the client, push the client to work at an appropriate intensity, and keep the client on task. Finally, companionship support might simply make exercise more fun to do, regardless the partner.

#### TRAINING TIP

When training clients, it is very important to avoid distractions and keep the focus on the person who is paying for your service. During a session, avoid getting into in-depth conversations with other health club members or coworkers, do not look at your phone during a session, and do not let small distractions shift your attention away from your client. By keeping your focus on your client, you will provide significant companionship support and also provide excellent customer service.

## Group Influences on Exercise

Group influences play a key role in many decision-making processes. As previously described, support can be given to a person in countless ways, but equally important is the person who provides that support. For example, young adults may be more influenced by their peers, while those in a mid-life stage might prefer support from a spouse or family member. Also, the source of information can be important; for instance, advice on overall health and well-being might be well received from a healthcare provider, but that same advice could be resisted when coming from a family member. Groups that may have a regular influence on physical activity are significant others, family members, peers, and exercise leaders. Regardless of the origin and the form of the support, a client needs to be open to taking that support for it to become effective.

### FAMILY

Family is one of the most important influences for most behaviors in life, especially for children and adolescents, but family influences are likely to remain strong throughout life. In research, the term *family* often refers to any family member, whether or not that person lives in the household, and individuals who live in a household but are not related. As stated previously, depending on the individual’s phase of life, the family influence can be quite different; younger people tend to be more influenced by parents, while mid-life and older adults are more influenced by a significant other. Social support for physical activity from family is particularly important for older adults as demonstrated by studies where family members were available to walk with and encourage exercise. (Böhm et al., 2016; Lindsay Smith et al., 2017).

Family support differs from other sources of support because family members are typically more permanent. If someone does not care for an exercise leader or group, they can simply discontinue, but the same is not true regarding family, whose behavioral influences could be positive or negative. Living with family members who are inactive and do not value exercise can be a source of constant barriers. Fitness professionals should get a sense of whether or not family members are supportive of exercise and if they can provide any support. It should be acknowledged when family members are not supportive so that other sources of support can be identified.
