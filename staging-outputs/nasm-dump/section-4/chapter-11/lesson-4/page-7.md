## Skinfold Measurements

**Skinfold measurements** continue to remain a popular method for determining body composition, although significant skill is required in locating the skinfold sites and accurately measuring fat folds using calipers. This takes practice, and it is recommended that fitness professionals learn from a trained professional before using these techniques. **Table 11: -6** provides descriptions of the different locations used by various skinfold measurement protocols.

**TABLE 11-6: Standardized Skinfold Sites of Measurement**

| Triceps: A vertical fold on the back of the arm, halfway between the shoulder and elbow.
	Biceps: A vertical fold on the anterior aspect over the belly of the biceps brachii muscle, 1 cm higher than the level of the triceps measurement.
	Chest: Men: A diagonal skinfold taken half the distance between the anterior axillary line (armpit) and the nipple. Women: A diagonal skinfold taken one-third the distance between the anterior axillary line and the nipple.
	Abdomen: A vertical skinfold taken 1 in. (2.54 cm) lateral to the umbilicus (belly button).
	Mid-axillary: Vertical fold taken on the mid-axillary line at the level of the xiphoid process (which is typically just below the nipple line).
	Subscapular: Diagonal fold, 1 to 2 cm below the inferior angle of the scapula.
	Suprailiac: A diagonal fold taken immediately superior to and in line with the natural angle of the iliac crest (top portion of the hip bone), aligned with the anterior axillary line.
	Thigh: A vertical skinfold taken midway between the hip and patella (kneecap). |  |

### CALIPER SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES

Skinfolds (SKF) are indirect measurements of the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat beneath the skin). The assumption is that the amount of fat present in the subcutaneous region of the body is proportional to overall body fatness, and most of the time, this is the case. Proper assessments of body composition using skinfolds include these recommendations:

	- Train with an individual skilled in SKF assessment and frequently compare your results against theirs.

	- Take a minimum of two measurements at each site; each site must be within 1 to 2 mm to take an average.

	- Completely open the jaw of the caliper before removing from the site.

	- Be meticulous when locating anatomic landmarks.

	- Do not measure SKFs immediately after exercise.

	- Instruct clients ahead of time regarding test protocol.

	- Avoid performing SKFs on obese clients.

## Key Terms
