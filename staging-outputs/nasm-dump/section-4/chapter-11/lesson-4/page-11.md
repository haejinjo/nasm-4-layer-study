## Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis

Unlike a skinfold assessment, **bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)** is a very easy body fat assessment to administer that does not require additional hands-on training or tables to reference. In this technique, sensors are applied to the skin, and a weak electrical current is run through the body to estimate body fat and lean body mass. Because muscle cells can contain as much as 70% to 75% water in comparison to fat cells that contain only about 10% to 15% water, a leaner individual will experience less resistance and reactance to the electrical flow versus an individual with more body fat (Porcari et al., 2015).Â In other words, fat is a less efficient conductor than lean body tissue; the faster the conduction, the leaner the individual (**Figure 11-1: 0**). Body weight scales with sensors, as well as handheld devices, are available to conduct this procedure.

Given the advances in technology in assessing body composition through BIA, and the concerns over SKF measurement (e.g., invasive nature, time investment, reliability of fitness professionals), BIA is becoming more commonly conducted in fitness settings. However, BIA does have its own limitations that can compromise the accuracy of the measurements taken. These include any event where the body either retains or loses water. Examples include fluctuating hydration levels, dehydration, extreme temperatures, heavy sweat rates, the use of diuretics, and even the presence of urine in the bladder volume. Furthermore, the quality of the BIA device is also an important consideration because lower-quality devices are more likely to produce inaccurate results versus higher-quality multi-extremity devices that measure at both extremities (i.e., hands and feet).

## Key Terms
