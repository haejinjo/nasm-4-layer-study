## Content
#### JACKSON AND POLLOCK SEVEN-SITE PROTOCOL

The **Jackson and Pollock 7-Site protocol**, like all SKF methods, mandates skill and proficiency on the part of the fitness professional in measuring the skinfold sites. To perform this assessment, the sum of the averages of the acceptable measurements from each site are totaled and used to calculate body density (Jackson & Pollock, 2004). The same seven sites are used for both men and women (**Table 11: -7**). Once the sum of the SKFs has been recorded, various online resources (e.g., tables, calculators) can be used for estimating body fat percentage.

**TABLE 11-7: Jackson and Pollock Seven-Site Measurement**

| Gender | Sites |
|---|---|
| Men | Chest, mid-axillary, subscapular, triceps, abdomen, suprailiac, thigh |
| Women | Chest, mid-axillary, subscapular, triceps, abdomen, suprailiac, thigh |

#### JACKSON AND POLLOCK THREE-SITE PROTOCOL

An alternative to the seven-site protocol is the **Jackson and Pollock 3-Site protocol**. The three-site method can be used for determining body composition in healthy populations. The chest, abdomen, and thigh locations are used for men, whereas the triceps, suprailiac, and thigh locations are used for women (**Table 11: -8**). This protocol holds good validity and offers convenience as it only requires measurements to be taken at three locations. Like the seven-site measurement, various online resources can be used for estimating body fat percentage once the three SKFs have been calculated.

**TABLE 11-8: Jackson and Pollock Three-Site Measurement**

| Gender | Sites |
|---|---|
| Men | Chest, abdomen, thigh |
| Women | Triceps, suprailiac, thigh |

#### FOUR-SITE DURNIN-WOMERSLEY PROTOCOL

The **Four-Site Durnin–Womersley protocol** is an alternative to the Jackson and Pollock formulas previously described. This formula uses a simple four-site upper body measurement process. The four sites include the biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac. The same four sites are used for both men and women (**Table 11: -9**).

**TABLE 11-9: Durnin–Womersley Four-Site Measurement**

| Gender | Sites |
|---|---|
| Men | Biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac |
| Women | Biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac |

## Key Terms

**Jackson and Pollock 7-Site protocol**
Measures the thickness of skinfolds at seven different places within the body to estimate body fat percentage.

**Jackson and Pollock 3-Site protocol**
Measures the thickness of skinfolds at three different places within the body to estimate body fat percentage.

**Four-site Durnin– Womersley protocol**
Measures the thickness of skinfolds at four different places (biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac) within the body to estimate body fat percentage.
