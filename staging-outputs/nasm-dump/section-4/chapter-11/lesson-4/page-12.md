## Hydrostatic Underwater Weighing

Underwater weighing (see **Figure 11-1: 1**), often referred to as hydrostatic weighing, has been the most common technique used in exercise physiology labs to determine body composition. This method is founded on the principle that bone, muscle, and connective tissues are denser and heavier in comparison to fat tissue, which is less dense, lighter, and floats. In essence, a person’s weight on land is compared to their underwater weight to determine fat percentage.

The science behind this process is **Archimedes’ principle**. Archimedes’ principle is a physical law of buoyancy. Because bone and muscle are denser than water, a person with a larger percentage of lean body mass will weigh more in the water and ultimately have a lower body fat percentage versus someone with less lean body mass. A person with more body fat will make the body lighter in water and will have a higher percentage of body fat. This technique is very accurate, but for obvious reasons, it is not practical outside of a laboratory setting.

## Key Terms

**Archimedes’ principle**
The assumption stating that the volume of fluid displaced is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in that fluid or to the specific fraction of the volume below the surface.
