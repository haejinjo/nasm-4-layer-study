# Conducting Health and Fitness  Assessments

Once the HRA is completed, and if the individual does not require medical clearance to initiate exercise, the fitness professional should then start to consider the need and the propriety of conducting various fitness assessments. Although fitness assessments provide lots of valuable information to the Certified Personal Trainer, clients may not feel comfortable undergoing specific assessments, especially if they believe they might not be able to complete the assessment. It’s possible that they might feel embarrassed by their results. For example, if Mary is deconditioned, the notion of completing a 1.5-mile run test might be both intimidating and uncomfortable. The decision on what and when to assess is never straightforward—it requires careful consideration on the part of the fitness professional.

## Assessment Considerations

A fitness professional should always be able to provide good rationale for any fitness assessments that they elect to conduct on a client. This rationale often manifests itself out of the following events, which should always be considered on a case-by-case basis (**Figure 11-2**).

## Assessment Sequencing

Some assessments should be conducted prior to performing specific exercises because of the way physical exertion impacts these measurements. For example, **resting heart rate (RHR)**, blood pressure, and skinfold body fat testing (all discussed later in this chapter) are acutely affected by physical exertion, which may skew results. On the other hand, flexibility is frequently assessed following a light cardio warm-up because at this time the body displays greater tissue extensibility.

Fitness assessments that do not require physical exertion, such as the measurement of RHR, blood pressure, or body composition, should always be conducted prior to more vigorous fitness assessments that measure aerobic fitness, strength, or power output.

### GETTING TECHNICAL

Physical activity raises a person’s heart rate and blood pressure. Consequently, measurements for RHR and blood pressure should be taken while the client is at rest.

Skinfold body fat testing should also be conducted while the client is in a rested state. **Thermoregulation **during exercise creates **peripheral vasodilation** at or around the skin to help remove heat, but this can increase a skinfold body fat measurement score.

## Key Terms

**Resting heart rate (RHR)**
The number of heart beats per minute while at complete rest.

**Thermoregulation**
The physiological process by which the body maintains a relatively constant internal body temperature, including events like sweating to cool the body and shivering to warm the body.

**Peripheral vasodilation**
The action of expanding the diameter of a blood vessel near the surface of the skin, which helps remove heat from the body.
