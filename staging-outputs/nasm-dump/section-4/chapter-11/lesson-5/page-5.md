## The 1.5-Mile Run Test

For more fit population groups, the **1.5-mile (2.4 km) run test** is a cardiorespiratory assessment that can be used to measure a client’s aerobic endurance. The 1.5-mile run test estimates aerobic fitness levels by either scoring the individual’s timed performance or their heart rate response, which is used to estimate VO~2max~ (Cooper Institute, 2007). This test, much like the Rockport walk test, was originally developed as a field test (i.e., conducted on a track), but it can be administered indoors on a treadmill.

**1.5-Mile Run Test Instructions**

	- Briefly discuss the protocol, answer all questions satisfactorily, and allow for adequate warm-up, stretching, and recovery prior to conducting the test.

	- Ensure that proper athletic footwear is worn for the test.

	- Terminate the test if the individual experiences any symptoms of light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, or excessive shortness of breath.

	- The goal of the test is to complete the 1.5-mile distance as quickly as possible. Pacing may be necessary.

**Test Interpretation:**

	- Use **Tables 11-15** and **11-16** to determine the results of the test.
