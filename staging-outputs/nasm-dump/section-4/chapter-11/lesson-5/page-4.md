## The Rockport Walk Test

For new exercisers who may not be very fit, a walking test is considered an appropriate cardiorespiratory assessment, providing an appropriate challenge while requiring little skill development or learning to complete the test. The** Rockport walk test** is a 1-mile walking test that predicts maximal oxygen consumption (VO~2max~) from either a timed performance or heart rate response. Fitness professionals should keep in mind that for fit individuals, this test will most likely underpredict their VO~2max~ because it was not designed for fit individuals (Morrow et al., 2016). While the test was originally developed for outdoor use on a track, it can also be used indoors using a treadmill.

**Rockport Walk Test Instructions**

	- Briefly discuss the protocol, answer all questions satisfactorily, and allow adequate warm-up, stretching, and recovery prior to conducting the test.

	- Ensure that proper athletic footwear is worn for the test.

	- Terminate the test if the individual experiences any symptoms of light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, or excessive shortness of breath.

	- The goal of the test is to complete the 1-mile (1.6-km) distance as quickly as possible. Pacing may be necessary, but no running or jogging is permitted. Instead, the client will walk as quickly as possible.

**Test Interpretation:**

	- Use **Table 11-1: 4** to determine results of the test.
