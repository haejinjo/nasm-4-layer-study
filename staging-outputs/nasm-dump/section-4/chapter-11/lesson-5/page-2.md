## VO2max

The most valid measurement of aerobic fitness is a VO~2max~ test. Oxygen consumption (VO~2~) is a measure of body’s usage rate of oxygen; it’s the difference between inspired and expired oxygen. It reflects the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the exercising muscles and use it in **mitochondria** to manufacture energy aerobically. VO~2max~, or maximal oxygen uptake, measures the body’s upper limit of oxygen use, which is sometimes called peak VO~2~.

	- A higher VO~2max~ score reflects greater oxygen utilization and a greater capacity for physical work.

	- VO~2max~ usually peaks at around ages 25 years to the early 30s, but it is highly trainable,implying that an active person in their 40s could have a higher VO~2max~ than during their sedentary 20s.

	- VO~2max~ decreases by approximately 5% per decade in fit individuals (an average of 0.5% per year) and around 10% per decade in unfit individuals (an average of 1.0% per year) (Kenney et al., 2015).

Conducting a V~O2max~ assessment provides the fitness professional with an indication of the client’s overall aerobic fitness. However, it is perhaps a better marker of health, mortality, and morbidity. VO~2max~ may be the single most effective predictor of heart function because VO~2~ scores reflect overall heart health (Aspenes et al., 2011). Individuals with higher VO~2max~ scores generally have healthier hearts, have a greater capacity to perform work, and may have lower risks of developing heart disease. However, it is not always practical to measure because of equipment requirements, time involved, and the willingness of clients to perform at maximal physical capacity. Therefore, submaximal tests are often the preferred method for determining cardiorespiratory functional capacity and fitness.

## Ratings of Perceived Exertion

A subjective rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a technique used to express or validate how hard a client feels that they are working during exercise. When using the RPE method, a person is subjectively rating the perceived difficulty of exercise. It is based on overall physical sensations experienced by a person during physical activity, which would include increased heart rate, increased respiration rate, increased sweating, and muscle fatigue. The client’s subjective rating should be reported based on the overall feelings of how hard they are working, including an overall sense of fatigue rather than isolated areas of the body (i.e., tired legs during treadmill testing). Although the RPE scale is a subjective measure, if clients report their exertion ratings accurately, RPE does provide a good estimate of the actual heart rate during physical activity. There are two versions of RPE: the original 6 to 20 scale, and the newer 1 to 10 scale (**Tables 11-11** and **11-12**). For simplicity and ease of use, NASM recommends the 1 to 10 scale.

**TABLE 11-12: RPE Scale, 1–10**

| Rating | Perceived Exertion Level |
|---|---|
| 0 | No exertion, at rest |
| 1 | Very light |
| 2-3 | Light |
| 4-5 | Moderate, somewhat hard |
| 6-7 | High, vigorous |
| 8-9 | Very hard |
| 10 | Maximum effort, highest possible |

## Key Terms

**Mitochondria**
The part of the cell that uses nutrients to create energy for the cell; commonly known as the powerhouse of the cell.

**YMCA 3-minute step test**
An aerobic test that measures the cardiovascular fitness of an individual based on a 3-minute bout of stair-stepping at a specific cadence.

**Recovery heart rate (RHR)**
The number of heartbeats measured after exercise ceases, which provides some indication of an individual’s fitness level (i.e., more conditioned people recover more rapidly).
