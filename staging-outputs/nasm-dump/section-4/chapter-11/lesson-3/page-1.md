# Fitness Assessment Protocols

Fitness assessments are an integral part of the services offered by fitness professionals to their clients. The ability to assess baseline measurements will facilitate the design and development of exercise programs while also providing a means to evaluate progress. Every fitness professional should possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities to select, administer, and interpret a variety of different physiological parameters aligned with their client’s health, fitness, or performance goals.

## Heart Rate

**Heart rate (HR)** is a valid indicator of work intensity or stress, both at rest and during exercise. Monitoring changes in resting HR helps to identify cardiovascular adaptations (becoming more aerobically fit) or regressions (deconditioning). Resting heart rate (RHR) lowers with improved fitness levels because the heart and lungs become more conditioned. When this occurs, the heart becomes stronger and can pump out more blood with each beat. This causes more oxygen and nutrients to be transported throughout the body. Conversely, when a person’s fitness level decreases, or they become ill, the RHR may elevate. These are important effects to understand because they provide the fitness professional with valuable physiological feedback on the training status of their client. However, it is also important to recognize that gender differences do exist in RHR, with men averaging approximately 5 to 10 fewer beats per minute than women (Porcari et al., 2015). These differences can be explained in part to the smaller sizes of the heart chambers and lower volumes of circulating blood in women, which require an elevated HR response. This means that RHR measurements for men and women should not be compared against each other to assess fitness levels. Rather, fitness professionals should gauge how an individual’s own RHR changes with training.

### MEASURING HEART RATE MANUALLY

HR can be measured at many points around the body (**Figure 11: -4**) where an artery’s pulsation is transmitted to the body’s surface, often occurring when a blood vessel is compressed against an underlying structure, such as a bone or joint. The RHR is most accurately measured just before an individual gets out of bed in the morning.

There are many anatomical locations that can be used to measure a client’s RHR. However, for accuracy, safety, and ease of administration, NASM recommends that fitness professionals measure a client’s radial pulse (**Figure 11: -5**).

## Key Terms

**Heart rate (HR)**
The measurement of the number of times a heart beats within a specified time period (usually 1 minute).
