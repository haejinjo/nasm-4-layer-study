## Content
Measuring BP takes proper guidance and practice. It is recommended that all individuals, including fitness professionals, attend a live training class to learn how to properly assess BP. The following paragraphs are generalized steps for assessing BP using an aneroid sphygmomanometer (for informational purposes only).

To record BP, instruct the client to assume a comfortable seated position and place the appropriate size cuff on the clientâ€™s arm just above the elbow. Next, either rest the arm on a supported chair, or support the arm using your own arm, and place the stethoscope over the brachial artery, using a minimal amount of pressure. Continue by rapidly inflating the cuff to 20 to 30 mm Hg above the point at which the pulse can no longer be felt at the wrist. Next, release the pressure at a rate of about 2 mm Hg per second, listening for a pulse. To determine the SBP, listen for the first observation of the pulse. Diastolic pressure is determined when the pulse fades away. For greater reliability, repeat the procedure on the opposite arm.

# CRITICAL

**Abnormal Readings**

If abnormal readings are made during a blood pressure assessment, repeat the measurement on the opposite arm. A significant discrepancy in the readings between the arms could represent a circulatory problem, and the individual should be referred to their physician for a medical evaluation.
