## Content
Following a static postural assessment, the fitness professional should implement an OHSA to evaluate dynamic posture, core stability, and neuromuscular control. This assessment will begin to expose various movement impairments that can be addressed with an individualized fitness program. Further, a single-leg squat assessment can then be used to test single-leg balance and challenge the client with a more demanding movement.

If the fitness professional has time, they can then implement upper-extremity pushing and pulling assessments to gain more information about how the client uses their upper body while stabilizing their trunk. These tests can be administered prior to a workout session or as an integrated part of the actual programming.

As a group, static postural and movement assessments provide a good overview about how the client positions and moves their body during everyday tasks. Any postural distortions or movement impairments can then be addressed with a focused exercise program, by stretching the identified overactive muscles and strengthening the identified underactive muscles.

If the client complains of pain during any of the movement assessments, further evaluation by a medical professional is recommended.

##### CRITICAL

It is not recommended to work with a client who is currently experiencing pain without proper clearance and direction by their physician.

Lastly, when working with an athletic population, it may be appropriate to implement various performance assessments. This is not common when working with the general population, but it may be necessary to help a client with athletic goals. These assessments can be selected based on the movement demands of the client’s sport. For example, a vertical jump test is commonly used with basketball athletes, whereas the pro shuttle is used with soccer athletes. These assessments help inform the exercise program design and can be used to track progress over time.

#### SEQUENCING ALL ASSESSMENTS

It is important for all assessments to be sequenced in a specific order to help guarantee accurate results (**Figure 12-2: 8**). For example, the fitness professional should always begin the assessments process with a preparticipation health screening (PAR-Q+, health history questionnaire), physiological (resting heart rate and blood pressure), and body composition (BMI, circumference, body fat percentage) assessments prior to performing assessments that require physical exertion (see Chapter 11). Physical exertion can skew the results of these assessments.

Once these assessments have been completed, the next step is to perform static postural and movement assessments. Lastly, cardio (aerobic/VT1 and anaerobic/VT2) tests and performance assessments can be administered. The fitness professional should choose to perform cardio and performance assessments on separate days to ensure the client’s energy levels are fresh to maximize accuracy of these assessments.
