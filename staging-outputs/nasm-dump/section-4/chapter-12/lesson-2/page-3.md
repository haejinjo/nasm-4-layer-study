## Content
The three postural distortion patterns to be assessed during a static postural assessment include the pes planus distortion syndrome (developed by NASM) and the lower and upper crossed syndromes described by Janda.

	- **Pes planus distortion syndrome**: Characterized by flat feet, knee valgus, and adducted and internally rotated hips (**Table 12: -1**)

	- **Lower crossed syndrome**: Characterized by an anterior pelvic tilt and excessive **lordosis** (extension) of the lumbar spine (**Table 12: -2**)

	- **Upper crossed syndrome**: Characterized by a forward head and protracted (rounded) shoulders (**Table 12: -3**)

**TABLE 12-1: Pes Planus Distortion Syndrome**

|  | Static Positions
Ankle joints—pes planus (collapsed arch)

Knee joints—valgus and internally rotated

Hip joints—adducted and internally rotated

Potential Muscle Imbalances

Potential overactive muscles

	Gastrocnemius and soleus (calves)
	Adductor complex (inner thighs)
	Hip flexors (muscles near front of hips)

Potential underactive muscles

	Anterior and posterior tibialis (shin muscles)
	Gluteus maximus and medius (butt muscles) |
|---|---|

**TABLE 12-2: Lower Crossed Syndrome**

|  | Static Positions
Hip joints—flexed

Pelvis—anterior pelvic tilt

Lumbar spine—excessive lordosis (extension)

Potential Muscle Imbalances

Potential overactive muscles

	Hip flexors
	Lumbar extensors (low-back muscles)

Potential underactive muscles

	Gluteus maximus and medius
	Hamstring complex
	Abdominals |
|---|---|

**TABLE 12-3: Upper Crossed Syndrome**

|  | Static Positions

Thoracic spine—excessive kyphosis (hunchback, flexed posture)

Shoulders—protracted (rounded forward) and internally rotated

Head and neck—jutted forward

Potential Muscle Imbalances

Potential overactive muscles

	Pectoralis major and minor (chest muscles)
	Levator scapula and sternocleidomastoid (neck muscles)
	Upper trapezius

Potential underactive muscles

	Middle and lower trapezius, rhomboids (mid-back muscles)
	Deep cervical flexors (muscle deep within the neck) |

## Key Terms

**Pes planus distortion syndrome**
Postural syndrome characterized by flat feet, knee valgus, and adducted and internally rotated hips.

**Lower crossed syndrome**
Postural syndrome characterized by anterior pelvic tilt and excessive lordosis of the lumbar spine.

**Lordotic/Lordosis**
The normal curvature of the cervical and lumbar spine regions, creating a concave portion of the spine.

**Upper crossed syndrome**
Postural syndrome characterized by a forward head and protracted shoulders.
