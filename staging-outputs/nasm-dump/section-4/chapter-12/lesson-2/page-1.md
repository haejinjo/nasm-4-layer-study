# Static Postural Assessment

A **static postural assessment** allows the fitness professional to look for any deviations from optimal alignment of the body in a standing posture. Over time, these deviations can cause muscle imbalances or compromise joint mobility. A static postural assessment requires strong visual observation skills that are developed with time and practice, and it requires a systematic approach. Commonly, static postural assessments begin at the feet and travel upwards toward the head. The static postural assessment includes **anterior**, lateral, and **posterior **views to observe all the potential deviations from optimal posture. Leveraging the** kinetic chain checkpoints** enables the fitness professional to systematically view the body during stance and motion. Although each region of the body will be assessed individually, the fitness professional should think of the body as an interconnected system, where one joint or region has an impact on the others. For example, overactive hip flexors from prolonged sitting may cause an **anterior pelvic tilt**, which then causes lumbar (low-back) extension.

The static postural assessment administered by a fitness professional is a simplified version of a thorough evaluation that would be performed by a healthcare professional, such as a physical therapist or physician. In general, the fitness professional should look for neutral alignment, symmetry, balanced muscle tone, and common postural deviations.

The kinetic chain checkpoints refer to major joint regions of the body, including the following:

	- Feet and ankles

	- Knees

	- Lumbo-pelvic-hip complex (LPHC)

	- Shoulders

	- Head and neck

**Anterior View** (**Figure 12: -2**)

	- Feet/ankles: Straight and parallel; not flattened or externally rotated

	- Knees: In line with toes; not in **knee valgus** (knock-kneed) or **knee varus** (bowlegged)

	- LPHC: Level pelvis; not rotated or hiked on one side

	- Shoulders: Level; not elevated or rounded

	- Head: Neutral position; not forward, tilted or rotated

Note: An imaginary line should begin between the feet, extending upward between the lower extremities, through the midline of the pelvis, and bisecting the trunk and skull.

**Figure 12-2Kinetic Chain Checkpoint Anterior View

**Lateral View** (**Figure 12: -3**)

	- Feet/ankles: Leg vertical at right angle to sole of foot

	- Knees: Neutral position; not flexed or hyperextended

	- LPHC: Pelvis and lumbar spine in neutral position; not anteriorly (lumbar extension) or posteriorly tilted (lumbar flexion)

	- Shoulders: Shoulders aligned with ears; not excessively rounded

	- Head: Neutral position; not “jutting” forward

Note: An imaginary line should run through the lateral malleolus (lateral ankle bone), middle of the femur (thigh bone), center of shoulder, and middle of the ear.

## Key Terms

**Static postural assessment**
An assessment that provides insight to deviations from optimal alignment of the body in a standing posture.

**Anterior**
On the front of the body.

**Posterior**
On the back of the body.

**Kinetic chain checkpoints**
The five areas of the body that are monitored during movement assessments and exercise: foot/ankle, knees, lumbo-pelvic-hip complex, shoulders, and head.

**Anterior pelvic tilt**
An excessive forward rotation of the pelvis that results in greater lumbar lordosis.

**Knee valgus**
Knees collapse inward (knock knees) due to hip adduction and internal rotation; also known as medial knee displacement and genu valgum.

**Knee varus**
Knees bow outward (bowlegged); also known as genu varum.
