## Content
The single-leg squat assessment has been shown to have strong inter- and intrarater reliability, meaning it can be evaluated consistently over time and between multiple professionals (Crossley et al., 2011; Garrick et al., 2018). Further, like the OHSA, observational screening during the single-leg squat is an accurate method to identify movement impairments, such as knee valgus (Harris-Hayes et al., 2014; Mauntel et al., 2013). The single-leg squat is observed from the anterior view.

### Single-Leg Squat Starting Position (Figure 12-12)

	- The client stands on a flat, stable surface, hands on the hips, and eyes focused forward.

	- The client lifts one foot approximately 6 in. off the floor. The stance foot, ankle and knee, and the LPHC should be in a neutral position and pointed straight ahead.

### Single-Leg Squat Movement (Figure 12-13)

	- The client squats as deep as possible (while maintaining balance) and returns to the starting position. The depth of the single-leg squat will be client dependent and will likely vary across populations.

	- The client performs up to five repetitions before switching sides.

**Anterior View**

	- The client’s knee should track straight forward and remain directly over the client’s second and third toes. A common movement impairment is knee valgus (**Figure 12-1: 4**).

When performing the single-leg squat assessment, fitness professionals should record all findings (**Table 12: -6**) and then refer to **Table 12: -7** to determine potential overactive and underactive muscles that will need to be addressed through flexibility and strengthening techniques. Remember, overactive muscles require stretching, whereas underactive muscles require additional strengthening to help correct the muscle imbalance.

The single-leg squat assessment is much more challenging than the OHSA, but it provides valuable information for the fitness professional about the client’s ability to balance on one leg.
