## Content
The pushing assessment can easily be integrated into a typical workout program, while providing useful information about the client’s shoulder mechanics and trunk stability during a pushing task. If the fitness professional plans to program pushing exercises, it is a good idea to assess this pattern of movement first.

## Pulling Assessment

The **pulling assessment** is an assessment that challenges the upper extremities and trunk during a pulling movement. This type of assessment can be completed prior to a workout session or as an integrated part of the actual programming. The pulling assessment evaluates upper-extremity strength, as well as stability of the LPHC, cervical spine, and head (Fenwick et al., 2009). Due to the narrow, split stance, this assessment also challenges the individual’s balance. The fitness professional should carefully evaluate all repetitions, because the client may demonstrate movement impairments as they become fatigued during the assessment.

### Pulling Assessment Start (Figure 12-20)

	- The client should stand in a narrow, split stance with toes pointing forward and handles in each hand.

	- The fitness professional should choose a resistance that will challenge (but not exhaust) the client while executing 10 repetitions.

If the client is not able to perform a standing row in a narrow, split stance, use one of the following modifications:

	- Option 1: The client stands in a wider split stance to increase their base of support. This testing position still assesses the upper extremity and cervical spine and head, but it decreases the challenge to the LPHC and the client’s balance.

	- Option 2: The client performs a pulling movement seated in a machine.

## Key Terms
