### TRAINING TIP

The squat and bench press strength assessments are not recommended for most clients seeking weight loss or improvements in overall health. These assessments are typically reserved for clients seeking improvements in maximal strength, such as strength and power athletes (e.g., football linemen, powerlifters, Olympic weightlifters).

Moreover, these assessments are not required for determining appropriate training loads (weight) during resistance training exercise for the average weight-loss client. If the client has experience with resistance training, the fitness professional should ask about the weights they typically use and adjust accordingly. If the client does not have experience with resistance training, the fitness professional should use caution and select a relatively light weight that the client can safely handle while learning the movement patterns. After a few sessions, with some trial and error, appropriate training loads can be determined. An appropriate training load is a weight that can be performed for the desired number of repetitions with ideal form, with the last few repetitions a struggle to complete.

## Vertical Jump Assessment

The **vertical jump assessment** is designed to test maximal jump height and lower-extremity power. There are several variations of the test; however, the version discussed here requires the use of a Vertec vertical jump tester. This test is considered an advanced assessment for power and performance-specific goals and, as such, may not be suitable for all clients. Generally speaking, Certified Personal Trainers should not perform this assessment for clients with general fitness or weight-loss goals. This test is most appropriate for clients with athletic goals and seeking to assess lower-body power. A proper warm-up is encouraged before beginning any maximal performance testing.
