## Content
## Divisions of the Skeletal System

The skeleton is divided into two parts: the axial and appendicular skeletal systems. The **axial skeleton** is made up of the skull, rib cage, and vertebral column. There are approximately 80 bones in the axial skeleton. The appendicular skeleton is made up of the arms, legs, and pelvic girdle. The **appendicular skeleton** encompasses approximately 126 bones (Hamill et al., 2015). In the human skeletal system, there are 206 bones of which approximately 177 are used in voluntary movement. The bones in the human body form more than 300 joints (Hamill et al., 2015).

## Bones

Bones serve two vital functions in movement. First, the bones act as **levers** or rigid rods where muscles attach. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on its respective bone, which produces movement (Tagliaferri et al., 2015). The second primary function of bones relative to movement is to provide support. This translates into posture, which is necessary for the efficient distribution of forces acting on the body (Floyd, 2018).

### BONE GROWTH

Throughout life, bone is constantly renewed through a process called **remodeling**, which is a process that consists of resorption and formation of the bone structure by special cells. **Osteoclasts** are special cells that break down and remove old bone tissue. **Osteoblasts** are special cells that form and lay down new bone tissue (Rolfe et al., 2013). During childhood through adolescence, new bone is added to the skeleton faster than old bone is removed. As a result, bones become larger, heavier, and denser (Dirckx et al., 2013).

For most people, bone formation continues at a faster pace than removal until bone mass peaks, which usually occurs by the time individuals reach their thirties (Floyd, 2018). It is also worth noting that bone remodeling, known as **Wolff’s law**, tends to occur along the lines of stress placed on the bone (Florencio-Silva et al., 2015). For example, activities, such as walking or running, may stimulate the femur (thigh) bones to remodel throughout the whole bone due to the weight-bearing stresses introduced during the activity.
