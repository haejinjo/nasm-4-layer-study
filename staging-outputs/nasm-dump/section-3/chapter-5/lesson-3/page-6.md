## Skeletal System Life Course

During normal childhood and adolescence, the skeletal system undergoes many changes. Throughout aging, the bones get longer by way of the **growth plate**. The growth plate is a specialized cartilage disc located in the epiphysis that is responsible for longitudinal bone growth (i.e., bone length) (**Figure 5-35**).

Bones also get stronger and denser with age. Up to 90% of peak bone mass and size is ac-quired by age 18 years in women and age 20 years in men, with total peak bone mass being reached around age 30 years for both sexes (Lu et al., 2016). Skeletal bone mass is stable between ages 30 and 50 years with a decline after this age range.

Older individuals may be at risk for acquiring osteoporosis, which is a bone disease that causes severely low bone mass and a high risk for fractures (Lu et al., 2016). Factors affecting peak bone mass include environmental, dietary, hormonal, lifestyle, physical activity, and genetic influences (Levine, 2012).

## Exerciseâ€™s Impact on Bone Mass

The fitness professional can help a client with maintaining or improving bone mass through exercise, specifically resistance training and weight-bearing exercise (Qaseem et al., 2017). Current universal recommendations include regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise to help improve agility, strength, posture, and balance. The goals are to improve bone strength and reduce the risk of falling for aging adults (Cosman et al., 2014; Qaseem et al., 2017). The fitness professional is encouraged to further research this topic using reliable sources, such as the National Osteoporosis Foundation, Osteoporosis Canada, Osteoporosis Australia, or the Royal Osteoporosis Society.
