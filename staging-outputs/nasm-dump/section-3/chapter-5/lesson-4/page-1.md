# Muscular System

The muscular system (**Figure 5-36**) links the nervous and skeletal systems and is responsible for generating the forces that move the human body. Muscles contract to create internal tension that, under the control of the nervous system, manipulates the bones to produce movements around the joints. The three types of muscles in the body are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Kenney et al., 2020). Cardiac muscle is what makes up the heart, and smooth muscle primarily makes up the tissues of internal organs. While each type is vital for the functioning of life itself, skeletal muscle holds the most importance for the fitness professionalâ€™s base of knowledge.
