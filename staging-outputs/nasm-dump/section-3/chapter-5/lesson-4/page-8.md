## Content
### MOTOR UNITS AND THE ALL-OR-NOTHING PRINCIPLE

Recall that muscles are functionally divided into motor units, with a single motor unit consisting of one motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. There are small and large motor units (Frontera & Ochala, 2015). Small motor units, which are more fatigue resistant and innervate small muscle fibers known as **type I**, contract slowly and generate relatively small forces. This is especially important for activities that require sustained muscle contractions, such as the maintenance of an upright posture. Smaller muscles with the primary purpose of stabilizing the body are mostly made up of type I muscle fibers.

Large motor units, which are faster to fatigue and innervate larger muscles fibers known as **type II**, generate more force more quickly than small motor units. This is especially important for physical activities that require large forces, such as running or jumping (Kenney et al., 2020). Big muscles that have the primary function of moving the body tend to have more type II muscle fibers than smaller muscles. These motor units are associated with specific muscle fiber types that are discussed in the next section.

If a nerve impulse is strong enough to trigger an action potential, then it will spread through the whole length of the muscle fiber. More specifically, it will spread through all the muscle fibers supplied by a single nerve. Conversely, if the stimulus is not strong enough, then there will be no action potential and no muscle contraction. This is known as the **all-or-nothing principle** (Pareti, 2007).

Motor units cannot vary the amount of force they generate; they either contract maximally or not at all. This is why the principle is named *all-or-nothing*. As a result of the all-or-nothing principle, the overall strength of a skeletal muscle contraction will depend on the type of motor unit recruited (i.e., whether the unit is larger or smaller) and the overall number of motor units that are activated at a given time (Pareti, 2007).

It should also be understood that the type of motor units making up a particular muscle will relate directly to the function of that muscle (Floyd, 2018). Muscles involved with fine motor control (e.g., muscles that control the eyes or the fingers) will have fewer fibers per motor unit. Conversely, muscles involved in big, powerful movements will have more fibers per motor unit (e.g., the quadriceps during a squat exercise) (Mackrill & Shiels, 2020; Rebbeck et al., 2014).

## Key Terms

**Type I muscle ﬁbers**
Muscle fibers that are small in size, generate lower amounts of force, and are more resistant to fatigue.

**Type II muscle ﬁbers**
Muscle fibers that are larger in size, generate higher amounts of force, and are faster to fatigue.

**All-or-nothing principle**
Motor units cannot vary the amount of force they generate; they either contract maximally or not at all.
