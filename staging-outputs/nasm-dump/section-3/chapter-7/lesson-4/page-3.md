### CLOSED-CHAIN MOVEMENTS

The primary characteristic of closed-chain movements is that the distal segments, such as a person’s hands or feet, are fixed and remain in contact with a stationary surface. Additionally, closed-chain exercises often require the movement of multiple joints in a predictable manner with the contraction of multiple muscle groups (Kisner & Colby, 2007).

While not required, a majority of closed-chain activities are weight-bearing. Examples of closed-chain exercises include push-ups, squats, pull-ups, or lunges.

During a squat or lunge, the distal segments (the legs) are fixed on a stable surface and movement occurs at the hips, knees, and ankles; multiple muscles are activated, including the entire gluteal and quadriceps groups. The resistance of bodyweight or a weighted bar is applied simultaneously to all the joints of the lower extremity. The same can be said for the upper extremities during push-ups or pull-ups, with the hands fixed either on the floor or on a static bar. During these movements, the body is moving while transferring the force back into the fixed, stable surface, with multiple joints in the kinetic chain dealing with the resistance (**Figure 7-13**).
