#### LATERAL SUBSYSTEM

The lateral subsystem (LS) is made up of the lateral hip (gluteus medius) and medial thigh muscles (adductors) and the contralateral quadratus lumborum, all of which provide movement in the frontal plane (**Figure 7-22**). Together, these muscles are tasked with creating and maintaining frontal plane (side-to-side) stabilization of the LPHC during movement.

The LS functions during numerous activities, which include movements that require a single-leg stance phase, such as seen during gait, running, and lunges. Furthermore, the LS provides stability of the lower extremities to prevent abnormal or unwanted frontal plane movement patterns during activities. For example, the LS prevents unwanted hip and thigh adduction during the squat (Kolber et al., 2017). An improperly working LS may be evident among those individuals who are unable to maintain appropriate lower-extremity alignment in the frontal plane (knees collapsing inward during a squat) (Kolber et al., 2017).

### SUBSYSTEM COORDINATION

While these subsystems have been described individually, it is important to recognize their coordinated and complex actions during movements. During physical activity, the subsystems work synergistically to perform efficient movements and stabilize the spine and pelvis.

Although the subsystems have been described only in the context of muscle activity, fitness professionals must remember that all movement relies on the nervous and skeletal systems as well. A deficit in joint function or failure of the nervous system to supply the appropriate signal can potentially lead to improper movement patterns, even if all muscles in a subsystem have proper length-tension relationships.
