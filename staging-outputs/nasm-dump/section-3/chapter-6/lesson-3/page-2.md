## Content
## Endocrine Glands

The primary endocrine glands are the **hypothalamus**, **pineal**, **pancreas**, **thyroid**, **pituitary**, **adrenal**, and **reproductive glands** (**Figure 6-11**). The hypothalamus is a key player for hormone actions because it serves to communicate messages from the body to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland controls the functions of many other endocrine glands. The pituitary has three different sections or lobes—the anterior, intermediate, and posterior lobe— and each lobe secretes specific types of hormones. Additionally, hormones can be secreted by both the liver and the stomach.

Much of the control of hormonal activity ultimately rests with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which are located in the brain. Together, they represent an important link between the nervous and endocrine systems (McArdle et al., 2016). Many of the hormones produced in this region directly influence the activities of other glands; thus, the hypothalamus and, sometimes, the pituitary gland are often referred to as the master glands (McArdle et al., 2016).

## Key Terms

**Hypothalamus**
A gland located in the brain that communicates with the pituitary gland.

**Pineal gland**
A small gland in the brain that secretes the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate sleep cycles.

**Pancreas**
An organ with numerous functions, including the production of insulin, glucagon, and digestive juices.

**Thyroid gland**
An endocrine gland, located in the anterior neck, responsible for the secretion of many hormones, including thyroxin and calcitonin.

**Pituitary gland**
An endocrine gland that controls the secretion of many hormones, including growth hormone.

**Adrenal gland**
A gland, located just above the kidneys, responsible for the secretion of catecholamines and cortisol.

**Reproductive glands**
Glands, such as the ovaries or testes, that serve sex-specific functions.
