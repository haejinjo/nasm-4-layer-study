## Content
However, evidence suggests that their role may be related to exercise intensity. In preparation for activity, the hypothalamus(part of the brain) and the nervous system of the body triggers the adrenal medulla to secrete more epinephrine. This will have several specific physiological effects that will help sustain exercise activity, such as:

	- Increase heart rate and stroke volume

	- Elevate blood glucose levels

	- Redistribute blood to working tissues

	- Open up the airways

	- Improve the body’s ability to break down and use fat for energy (McArdle et al., 2016)

##### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Due to neural stimulation from exercise, the adrenal glands can immediately produce epinephrine, which increases energy and force production during an exercise session (French et al., 2007; Kraemer & Ratamess 2005).

### CORTISOL

Cortisol is typically referred to as a **catabolic** hormone (associated with tissue breakdown). Under times of stress, such as exercise, cortisol is secreted by the adrenal cortex and serves to maintain energy supply through the breakdown of fats and protein. One of the mechanisms by which cortisol serves to maintain energy is through **gluconeogenesis**. Gluconeogenesis increases glucose availability by creating energy substrates from both fats and proteins. In other words, gluconeogenesis is the breakdown of noncarbohydrate sources to be used as energy.

High levels of cortisol brought about through **overtraining**, excessive stress, poor sleep, and inadequate nutrition can lead to significant breakdown of muscle tissue, along with other potentially harmful side effects. Evidence suggests that low blood glucose and poor sleep may stimulate an increase in cortisol (Leproult & Cauter, 2010; Qaid & Abderlrahman, 2016). Cortisol is normally elevated early in the morning with declining levels throughout the day and into early hours of sleep. When sleep time is reduced, cortisol levels are elevated in early evening hours (Leproult & Cauter, 2010).

#### TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN

**Testosterone** is produced in the testes of the male body and in small amounts in the ovaries and adrenal glands of the female body. Males produce up to 10 times more testosterone than females, and it is primarily responsible for the development of the male secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial and body hair and greater muscle mass (McArdle et al., 2016).

For both males and females, testosterone plays a fundamental role in the growth and repair of tissue. Raised levels of testosterone are indicative of an **anabolic** (tissue-building) status. Evidence suggests that testosterone levels decline with age; however, they can increase in response to high-intensity interval training or strength training with sufficient overload, whereby large muscle masses are trained, and shorter rest periods are incorporated (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005).

## Key Terms

**Catabolic**
Metabolic process that breaks down molecules into smaller units used for energy.

**Gluconeogenesis**
The formation of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources (proteins and fats).

**Overtraining**
Excessive frequency, volume, or intensity of training, resulting in reduction of performance, which is also caused by a lack of proper rest and recovery.

**Testosterone**
A hormone producing secondary male sex characteristics.

**Anabolic**
Metabolic process that synthesizes smaller molecules into larger units used for building and repairing tissues.
