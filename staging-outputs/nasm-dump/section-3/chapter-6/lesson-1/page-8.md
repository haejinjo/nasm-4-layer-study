## Content
The increase in cardiac output may be the result of an increase in stroke volume or heart rate. During exercise, it is likely for both heart rate and stroke volume to increase. However, a favorable adaptation to exercise seen in endurance athletes includes an increase in stroke volume over time, which allows the heart to maintain the same level of circulation at a lower heart rate. Monitoring the heart rate during exercise provides a good estimate of the amount of work the heart is doing at any given time (Brooks, 2000; Swain, 2014). **Figure 6-6** illustrates the procedure for manually monitoring the heart rate.

Another common procedure used to monitor the heart rate is with a heart rate monitor, which is worn on the body and automatically derives the BPM. While these monitors are sometimes strapped around the chest, more frequently, they are integrated into smartwatches and other wearable technologies. There is even a body of evidence suggesting that smartphone apps (on devices equipped with a biometric fingertip scanner) may be a valid tool for measuring heart rate when compared with chest straps and other medical-monitoring devices (Cheatham et al., 2015; Reid, 2014). Conversely, face scan capabilities, which are currently available on some modern smartphones, have not been shown to offer accurate heart rate measurements and are not recommended for use at this time (Cheatham, 2015).

# GETTING TECHNICAL

Recall from Chapter 5 that the autonomic nervous system is divided into two subsystems: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for increasing neuromuscular activation for activity, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for reducing neuromuscular activation needed for rest, digestion, and recovery. In that light, the heart is very similar to skeletal muscle.

During exercise, the sympathetic nervous system sends signals to the heart to increase the rate of conduction to meet the oxygen demands of the body; meanwhile, the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for slowing the rate of conduction as activity intensity is reduced (Reid et al., 2014).
