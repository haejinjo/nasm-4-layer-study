## Content
Normal blood pressure is classified as having a systolic of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic of less than 80 mm Hg (Whelton et al., 2018).

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology provide guidelines for classifying someone with **hypertension** (high blood pressure) (**Table 6-2**) (Whelton et al., 2018). While these guidelines are more recent, the European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Hypertension classify a systolic blood pressure greater than 139 mm Hg and diastolic pressure greater than 89 mm Hg as being hypertensive (Brakis, 2019).

**TABLE 6-2 Stages of Hypertension**

| American Heart Association Blood Pressure Classification | Criteria (mm Hg) |
|---|---|
| Normal | Systolic <120 and diastolic <80 |
| Elevated | Systolic 120–129 and diastolic <80 |
| Stage 1 | Systolic 130–139 or diastolic 80–89 |
| Stage 2 | Systolic ≥140 or diastolic ≥90 |
| Hypertensive crisis | Systolic >180 and/or diastolic >120 |

# HELPFUL HINT

When reading blood pressure, the top number always reflects systolic blood pressure, when the heart contracts, while the bottom number represents diastolic pressure, when the heart is at rest and filling up with blood.

## Key Terms

**Hypertension**
Consistently elevated blood pressure.
