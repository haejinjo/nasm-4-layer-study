## Content
The primary roles of vitamin C are that of collagen synthesis and antioxidant activity. Collagen is a type of protein found in skin, tendons, and ligaments; vitamin C is an essential component in its synthesis. Chronic deficiency of this vitamin can lead to a condition called scurvy, which is a result of collagen breakdown leading to tissue rupture. Vitamin C also functions as an antioxidant to neutralize oxidative and free radical damage to cell linings, DNA and RNA, and lipoproteins.

The B vitamins may be classified into two groups. One group plays a key role in red blood cell (RBC) synthesis and an energy-metabolism group, which has a significant role in energy-producing pathways, such as glycolysis and the Cori (Krebs) cycle. The B vitamins involved in RBC synthesis include folate and vitamins B6 and B12. Deficiencies in these vitamins can lead to different types of anemia (deficiency of hemoglobin or RBCs) due to inadequate RBC synthesis. Folate also plays an important role in DNA and RNA synthesis; it is important in the prevention of neural tube defects (birth defects in the brain or spinal cord) and certain types of cancer (Duthie, 2011). The energy metabolism group of B vitamins include thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamins B6 and B12. Derivatives and metabolites of these vitamins are involved in the metabolic pathways that facilitate the process of ATP synthesis from carbohydrates and amino acids.

Deficiencies in these B vitamins can manifest as fatigue, confusion, lethargy, and compromised athletic performance. Severe deficiencies of these vitamins can have more serious health outcomes beyond the scope of this text.

## Minerals

Minerals are compounds that can be found in both plant and animal foods. From a nutrition perspective, minerals may be grouped into two categories: major and trace. The **major minerals** are present in the body in larger amounts and are also required in larger quantities in the diet as compared to the **trace minerals**. The major minerals include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and sulfur. Trace minerals, which include iron, zinc, copper, selenium, iodine, manganese, chromium, fluoride, and molybdenum, are required in much smaller quantities in the diet. Like vitamins, minerals do not provide any calories, but they are essential to structural development and the regulation of many metabolic processes (**Tables 9-17** and **9-18**). The daily requirements for the vitamins and minerals for various age groups, as recommended by the National Academy of Medicine, may be found at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine website.

### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Of the major minerals, calcium and phosphorus are present in the largest amounts in the human body and are primarily contained in bone and skeletal tissue. A healthy, well-balanced diet provides adequate quantities of the major and trace minerals for most people’s needs. In cases of inadequate intakes, increased needs, or impaired dietary absorption, supplementation may be necessary.
