## Content
It is also important to note that protein intake at high levels requires an increase in fluid intake and should not be undertaken in the presence of any medical issues that contraindicate high-protein diets, such as kidney disease or urea cycle disorders. Despite the thermic benefits of higher-protein diets for fat loss and diet quality, overall macro- and micronutrient intake remain important for general health. Higher-protein intake at the expense of other macro- and micronutrients is not advised if it poses nutrient deficiencies and any adverse health issues. Maintaining adequate protein intake to minimize the loss of lean muscle mass while in a calorie deficit for fat loss remains important. Protein intake in the range of 1.6–2.2 g/kg of body weight per day, while in a net caloric deficit, has been shown to maintain lean body mass among athletes seeking to reduce body fat levels for competition or a physique sport (Kerksick et al., 2018) (**Table 9-22**).

**TABLE 9-22 Fat Loss Strategies**

| Fat Loss Strategies | Strategy | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Moderate calorie deficit | Portion control | ¼ plate of pasta versus ½ plate at meals |
| Replace high-calorie foods with leaner substitutes | Side salad instead of fries or potato chips |
| Select lean proteins in place of high-fat proteins | Skinless chicken breast versus fried chicken |
| Replace highly processed and high-calorie items with whole, nutrient-dense foods | A whole apple versus an apple strudel as a snack |
| Limit the frequency and portion of high-calorie foods, such as desserts | Dessert once or twice a week versus daily |
| Select higher-fiber foods (vegetables, fruits, and whole grains) in place of lower-fiber and calorie-dense foods | Vegetables instead of macaroni and cheese as a side dish |
| Replace high-calorie drinks with water or other calorie-free beverages | Water, seltzer, flavored water, tea, or black coffee instead of sweetened sodas, juices, energy drinks, and other beverages |
| Increase energy expenditure | Increase physical activity through regular exercise (EAT) | A minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week |
| Increase physical activity through nonexercise activities of daily living (NEAT) | Walking instead of driving
	Taking the stairs versus the escalator or elevator
	Walking for pleasure
	Gardening or yardwork
	Household chores
	Standing or pacing while talking on the phone |
| Increase TEF | Maintain a slightly higher protein intake to minimize loss of lean muscle mass | Include an adequate lean source of protein at each meal |

Fat loss ultimately requires adherence to a caloric deficit over a period of time. Adherence to strategies in Table 9-22 remains a key factor in achieving fat loss. Fitness professionals working with clients who have goals of fat loss/improved body composition should reinforce the idea that fat loss takes time and consistency with training and diet will be important factors for success.
