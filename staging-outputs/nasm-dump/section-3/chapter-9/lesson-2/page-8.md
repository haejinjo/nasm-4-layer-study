## Content
### EXERCISE AND ANABOLIC NEEDS

Exercise, both **aerobic **and **anaerobic**, can increase protein requirements for an individual, because of increased protein turnover from muscle breakdown and recovery as well as an in- crease in oxidation of amino acids to meet energy needs (Kerksick et al., 2018). Most clients will likely be consuming more than 0.8 g/kg of body weight for protein through their diet but that can vary depending on their specific needs and factors. Sports nutrition guidelines, from various authorities, provide the following recommended ranges of protein intake for strength and endurance athletes (**Table 9-6**).

**TABLE 9-6 Recommended Protein Intake Ranges (per day)**

| Population | Quantity | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sedentary adults | 0.8 g/kg of body weight | USDA Dietary Guidelines |
| Strength/resistance trained athletes | 1.6–1.7 g/kg of body weight | Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Karpinski & Rosenbloom, 2017) |
| Endurance athletes | 1.2–1.4 g/kg of body weight | Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Karpinski & Rosenbloom, 2017) |
| Most exercising individuals (to build and maintain muscle mass) | 1.4–2.0 g/kg of body weight | International Society of Sports Nutrition (Kerksick et al., 2018) |

#### GETTING TECHNICAL

Current sports nutrition recommendations for protein also vary, and the following ranges have been suggested by various sports nutrition authorities.

	- 0.25–0.55 g/kg of body weight or 20–40 g per meal, 3–4 hours apart (Kerksick et al., 2018)

	- 0.24 g/kg of body weight, or a range of 0.18–0.30 g/kg per meal (Moore et al., 2015; Morton et al., 2018)

	- 0.4–0.55 g/kg protein per meal (over four meals per day) for optimal muscle building (Schoenfeld & Aragon, 2018).

The take-home message is that the RDA for protein (0.8 g/kg per body weight) is likely too low for most active individuals and athletes.

An individual client’s needs for protein will vary, depending on the client’s goals, training volume, and intensity as well as any medical or health conditions. Fitness professionals may direct clients to information on optimal protein sources and provide general recommendations. However, clients seeking specific protein-intake recommendations should be advised to work with an RD or other nutrition professional to determine their overall needs and optimal range of protein intake.
