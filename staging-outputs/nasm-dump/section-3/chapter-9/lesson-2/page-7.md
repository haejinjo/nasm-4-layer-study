## Content
From the liver, amino acids may be directed to different tissues and used in a variety of ways:

	- Synthesis of new proteins

	- Repair of existing proteins

	- Synthesis of nonessential amino acids

	- Transamination to other nonessential amino acids (i.e., transferring an amino group from one molecule to another)

	- Synthesis of nonprotein, nitrogen-containing compounds

	- Usage to meet energy needs, if caloric or carbohydrate intake is inadequate

### PROTEIN USE FOR ENERGY

Arguably, protein’s primary function is to synthesize new proteins and repair existing proteins. However, if an individual does not eat adequate calories to meet their energy needs, then dietary protein and/or protein from bodily tissue may be used to meet this need. In this situation, amino acids from the proteins are deaminated (i.e., the nitrogen component is removed), and the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen components are metabolized to meet energy needs. The deaminated nitrogen component is incorporated into urea by the liver and then excreted by the kidneys in urine. Some amino acids, such as alanine and glutamine, may also be used to create glucose through a process called **gluconeogenesis**.

Clients seeking to build muscle through their training should understand the dual importance of adequate caloric and protein intake to optimize results from their exercise program.  It may be helpful for a Certified Personal Trainer to reinforce the importance of adequate caloric and protein intake to complement training protocols. If clients are unsure of their dietary needs, then they should be referred to a nutrition or healthcare professional for further guidance.

## Protein Dietary Needs

Protein needs vary for individuals and are dependent on several factors unique to the individual: age, size, caloric needs, current body composition, physical activity, sport/performance goals, body composition goals, health status, and injury status. Both clients and fitness professionals should remember that one client’s protein needs may be very different from those of another client. Consider that each client has a different goal, build, and structure and may need a different training protocol that varies in type of exercise, intensity, and duration. Their energy and macronutrient needs will also differ from other clients who have a different build, structure, goal set, and training protocol. Fitness professionals may provide clients with general guidelines on protein requirements, but for more individualized prescriptions, especially if a client has a health concern, they should be referred to an RD or other licensed nutritionist.

### RECOMMENDED DIETARY ALLOWANCE (RDA)

The **recommended dietary allowance (RDA) **for protein is 0.8 g/kg of body weight and is considered to be a minimum amount of protein required to maintain nitrogen balance in the body or to offset nitrogen losses that are a result of normal metabolic processes (Wolfe et al., 2017). However, protein requirements increase under several circumstances, including exercise and anabolic needs, **negative energy balance**, illness, or injury. Under most circumstances, the actual protein intake of most individuals falls within the range of 10% to 35% of total calories, considered the **acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) **for protein as a percentage of an individual’s diet (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).

## Key Terms

**Gluconeogenesis**
The formation of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources (proteins and fats).

**Recommended dietary allowance (RDA)**
The recommended amount of a nutrient that meets the needs of most healthy individuals within specific age and gender groups.

**Negative energy balance**
When calorie intake is lower than the number of calories expended.

**Acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR)**
Ranges of intake for nutrients that are estimated to meet the needs of 97–98% of the population and that are associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease. AMDRs are established by the National Academy of Medicine.
