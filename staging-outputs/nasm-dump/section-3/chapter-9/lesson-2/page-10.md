### PROTEIN CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCERNS

Clients may ask two important questions: (1) How much protein is too much? (2) Is there any danger from consuming too much protein? Unless individuals have a medical diagnosis or condition that requires a limited protein intake, a higher-protein diet that provides greater than 2.2 g/kg of protein is unlikely to have an adverse effect for most healthy individuals and may help improve body composition, especially when combined with resistance training (Kerksick et al., 2018; Layman et al., 2005).

Some reported side effects of very high protein diets (protein consumption up to 2.2 g/kg of body weight) have been reported and could include the following issues:

	- Constipation and gastrointestinal issues

	- Increased excretion of calcium

	- Increased risk of kidney stones or gout (Delimaris, 2013)

However, reports of side effects are inconsistent and may be affected by the choice of protein and possible inadequate fluid intake. Fluid intake should be increased when protein intake increases to facilitate the body’s removal of urea, a waste product from protein consumption. Protein intake in excess of 2.2 g/kg body weight may be unnecessary for healthy, active individuals seeking to improve their body composition; also, it may be undesirable if it contributes to an imbalance in the overall diet and/or a deficiency in other macronutrients and micronutrients. Optimal protein intake should support health, fitness, and performance goals without compromising the structure of an overall balanced diet that includes adequate nutrients for an individual’s needs.
