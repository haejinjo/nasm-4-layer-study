### PERCENT DAILY VALUE

The **percent daily value (%DV)** on a nutrition facts label is another useful tool that clients can use to compare the nutritional value of different products. These daily values are indicated for all the listed nutrients on the nutrition facts label, except trans fats, total sugars, and protein, as the Food and Drug Administration has not established recommended daily amounts for these nutrients.

#### GETTING TECHNICAL

Dietary guidelines recommend limiting dietary trans fats, therefore, recommended daily values have not been defined for trans fats. There is also no %DV for total sugar, as there are no defined recommendations for total sugar that should be eaten in a day. However, dietary guidelines do recommend limiting added sugar to no more than 10% of daily calories (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015). The %DV for protein is not listed on the nutrition facts label for most products, because most U.S. adults are not considered to be at risk for low protein intake. However, the %DV for protein is required to be listed if a specific claim about protein is made on the product (e.g., Good Source of Protein), or the product is intended for use by infants and children less than 4 years old.

The %DV indicates the percentage of the recommended daily value for a nutrient is met by the specified serving size of a food product, based on a standard 2,000-calorie diet. If an individual’s needs are greater than 2,000 calories per day, then the specified serving would provide less than their daily recommended intake for that nutrient.

These daily values can also help consumers identify if a product is high or low in certain nutrients or if it is a good source of any nutrient(s). In general, a %DV of 5 or less indicates that a product is low in that nutrient, whereas a %DV of 20 or more indicates that it is high, or a good source of that nutrient. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2019) recommends that individuals select products that provide 5% or less of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium and 20% or more for fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

#### TRY THIS

Look at the nutrition facts label for a product that you have at home, such as cereal, soup, or a protein bar. Look at the %DVs for each of the listed nutrients. Answer the following questions:

	- What is the %DV for total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, and fiber?

	- Is the %DV for saturated fat less than or greater than 5%? What does this tell you about the product?

	- Is the %DV for fiber less than or greater than 5%? What does this tell you about the product?

The nutrition facts label also lists the amount in micro- or milligrams and the %DV for vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium, since most U.S. adults do not consume these nutrients in recommended amounts. Other vitamins and minerals are not required to be listed on the panel unless they have been added to the product or if a claim is made about the nutrients, for instance, “This product is a good source of folate.”

## Key Terms

**Percent daily value (%DV)**
A reference value on the nutrition label that indicates what percentage of the recommended daily value for a nutrient is met by the specified serving size of a food product, based on a 2,000-calorie diet.
