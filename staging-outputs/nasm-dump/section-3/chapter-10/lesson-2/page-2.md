## Content
Not all dietary supplements may pose a serious risk when consumed in high quantities, but for the supplements with established recommended daily intakes (vitamins and minerals), there are often established tolerable upper limits. Intakes above the **tolerable upper limit** may result in **adverse effects** or toxicity (**Table 10-1**). Toxicity occurs when too much of a vitamin or mineral accumulates within the body, such as with hypervitaminosis A, and produces symptoms, such as altered vision, bone pain, and/or dry, cracked skin.
