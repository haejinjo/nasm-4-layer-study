## Content
There is also the possibility of contamination, which is why athletes and exercisers may want to only use dietary supplements with third-party verification (Informed Choice or NSF). As much as 25% of dietary supplements may be adulterated with a banned substance (Geyer et al., 2004). The FDA maintains an online database of products that have been found to contain hidden ingredients not listed on the label, such as banned substances and prescription medications.

### BANNED SUBSTANCES

Some dietary supplements enter the market as legal but are eventually reclassified. In recent history, this has occurred with some stimulants, and further back in history, there was a time that anabolic steroids were not banned from use in competitive sports. While some banned substances by WADA or NCAA are not always dangerous, most are confined to prescription drugs and are not legal for everyday use.

Beyond caffeine, many stimulants are considered banned substances in one country or another. The United States is relatively liberal on stimulant use, allowing stimulants, such as hordenine (a chemical found in barley) and yohimbine (derived from the bark of an evergreen tree found in Africa). By contrast, Great Britain only allows caffeine in dietary supplements. Two of the more well-known stimulants banned in the United States are **DMAA** (dimethylamylamine) and **ephedra** (an herb containing ephedrine and other stimulants). DMAA and ephedra were banned following reports of **serious adverse effects**, including several deaths resulting from cardiovascular stimulation.

Anabolic steroids are another class of ergogenic aids. These steroids are derived from a **hormone precursor**, usually **testosterone**, and are used primarily for increasing muscle mass and strength and the loss of body fat. Some side effects of steroids can be permanent, such as **gynecomastia** (swollen male breast tissue) and hair loss, while others are transient, only occurring while the individual uses steroids, such as aggression (Hoffman & Ratamess, 2006). A list of side effects can be found in **Table 10-7**.
