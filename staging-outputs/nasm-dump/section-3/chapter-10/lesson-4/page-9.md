# Supplementation and the Certified Personal Trainer

The Certified Personal Trainer can expect to be asked many questions about dietary supplements and nutrition, and some of those questions may be beyond a fitness professional’s scope of practice. As such, every Certified Personal Trainer must understand and stay within their own scope of practice; but it is important to realize a fitness professional’s scope of practice may vary depending on the state or country in which they reside.

For example, while some supplements may be effective for weight loss and are legal in many countries, they may also be dangerous for certain individuals with preexisting conditions. It is the responsibility of the fitness professional to provide education on the topic of dietary supplements versus prescribing specific supplements. Subsequently, their clients will be able to make informed decisions and minimize associated risks.

Dietary supplements may have negative interactions with other supplements or medications, or they should not be used by individuals with specific medical problems, such as high blood pressure and conditions that use stimulants. Before taking on a client, the fitness professional should gather background information through health history questionnaires. This information can be used to more safely educate clients’ supplementation questions, but it will not protect the fitness professional in every situation. Nonetheless, some employers may require Certified Personal Trainers to recommend supplements to clients as part of the facility’s package offerings, and fitness professionals should understand these requirements prior to employment.

## Expectations of the Certified Personal Trainer

Providing nutritional or dietary supplement prescriptions is beyond the Certified Personal Trainer’s scope of practice. It is appropriate for the fitness professional to direct a client to their physician or dietitian for dietary or supplement advice. The Certified Personal Trainer may find it appropriate to recommend dietary supplements pending physician or dietitian approval as well. For example, the Certified Personal Trainer may suggest that a client ask their doctor first before trying an essential amino acid supplement. Referring a client to a physician is especially important when suggesting dietary supplements containing stimulants, as this category is the most likely to produce adverse effects.

The fitness professional may offer general advice regarding healthy eating habits but may not prescribe specific meal plans or nutritional therapy, including dietary supplements. Some examples of general advice include dispelling nutrition and supplementation myths and fallacies, teaching healthy portion sizes, instructing how to read food and supplement labels, discussing findings from peer-reviewed research about the effectiveness of supplements, and discussing the health benefits of various food groups and macronutrients.

### CRITICAL

Always instruct your clients to ask their medical professional for their opinion, if not their approval, on any dietary suggestion, including dietary supplements, particularly if a client is taking medication(s) or has a disease or medical condition.
