# Welcome to NASM!

We live in an increasingly automated society that requires less and less physical activity from people each day. With each passing year, technological advancements continue to make our lives easier. Sedentary lifestyles and convenience-focused diets continue to fuel elevated rates of **obesity** and related chronic health conditions, keeping the need for scientifically educated fitness professionals at an all-time high. Alongside other practitioners in the greater allied health industry, Certified Personal Trainers represent a powerful force for change, helping clients improve their fitness for long-lasting health and happiness. Congratulations on taking the first step toward becoming an NASM Certified Personal Trainer!

## The NASM Certified Personal  Trainer Credential

The National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) personal training credential provides the scientific foundation necessary to begin an exciting career as a fitness professional. However, earning the NASM personal training credential is only the beginning. A successful career as a fitness professional requires ongoing and continued growth as the fitness industry continues to evolve. Adhering to the most current, research-supported training and coaching principles helps ensure that fitness professionals can safely and effectively change the lives of their clients for the better.

The state of knowledge within the personal training field is growing at a rapid rate. According to Buckminster Fuller’s Knowledge Doubling Curve, human knowledge doubles approximately every century. In the medical field, knowledge doubles every few months (Densen, 2011).  Because staying physically fit and eating healthy is one of the best forms of preventive medicine, it is essential that fitness professionals stay current and continue to learn. The fitness industry is a vast landscape full of misinformation and social media trends; however, it is also full of amazing new techniques and methodologies that drive human performance forward. For that reason, fitness professionals need to be open to new ideas and be able to differentiate facts from fads to design safe, effective, and results-oriented programs for their clients.
