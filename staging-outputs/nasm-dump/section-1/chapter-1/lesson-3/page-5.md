## Content
Exercise also promotes positive physiological changes, such as encouraging the heart’s arteries to dilate (i.e., open) more readily, which improves blood flow (Bruning & Sturek, 2015). The overall impact of physical activity and exercise on reducing the risk of heart disease is significant and dramatic; regardless of the presence or absence of ischemic heart disease and existing risk factors, every adult should be encouraged to participate in regular exercise over the course of their lifetime (Agarwal, 2012).

#### HELPFUL HINT

**Exercise Versus Physical Activity**

Exercise is a structured and planned form of human movement to elicit a physical adaptation, such as weight loss or improved endurance or strength. Examples of exercise include weight lifting, cycling, running, or swimming. Exercise programs can occur in a gym setting or outside and can also be performed alone or in a group setting.

**Physical activity** refers to movement that expends energy, such as walking, yardwork, recreational sports, or playtime. Physical activity can be categorized as continuous or intermittent and can be performed across a wide range of intensity levels, from walking a dog to vigorously shoveling snow after a storm. Physical activity is not typically structured or planned, rather, it represents natural movement throughout a person’s day.

### HYPERTENSION

**Hypertension**, specifically, is one of the primary risk factors for heart disease and stroke (World Health Organization, 2019). Hypertension is categorized by a blood pressure greater than 120/80 (systolic/diastolic) millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) (Hernandez-Vila, 2015). Fitness professionals need to promote awareness of hypertension and encourage clients to modify risk factors, such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use.

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

**Systolic blood pressure (SBP)** is the pressure in arteries and other blood vessels when the heart is beating or contracting. It is the first (top) number recorded.

**Diastolic blood pressure (DBP)** is the pressure in arteries and other blood vessels when the heart is at rest or between beats; it is the second (bottom) number recorded.

Blood pressure is classified as follows:

	- Normal (healthy): Less than 120/80 mm Hg

	- Elevated: Systolic between 120 and 129 and diastolic less than 80 mm Hg

	- Stage 1 hypertension: Systolic between 130 and 139 or diastolic between 80 and 89 mm Hg

	- Stage 2 hypertension: Systolic 140 or higher or diastolic 90 mm Hg or higher

	- Hypertensive crisis: Systolic greater than 180 and/or diastolic greater than 120 mm Hg (Whelton et al., 2018)

Scientific evidence indicates that the risk of cardiovascular complications not only doubles when systolic and diastolic blood pressure are chronically above normal levels, but also increases proportionally with age (Prospective Studies Collaboration, 2002). Updated guidelines that use more conservative definitions of high blood pressure are designed to increase awareness earlier and promote healthy behaviors aimed at preventing hypertension and controlling it if a diagnosis has been reached (Whelton et al., 2018).

## Key Terms

**Physical activity**
Bodily movement that results in energy expenditure and encompasses many modes and intensities. Movement that is not structured exercise such as recreational pursuits (e.g., golfing, gardening, and walking a dog).

**Hypertension**
Consistently elevated blood pressure.

**Systolic blood pressure (SBP)**
The pressure in arteries and other blood vessels when the heart is contracting; the first (top) number recorded.

**Diastolic blood  pressure (DBP)**
The pressure in arteries and other blood vessels when heart is at rest or between beats; the second (bottom) number recorded.
