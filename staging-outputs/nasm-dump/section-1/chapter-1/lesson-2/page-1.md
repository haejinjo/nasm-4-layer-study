# The Global State of Health

The current global state of health is a complex subject with many moving pieces, including factors that are often beyond the control of the individual, such as genetics, access to health care, access to preventive medicine, natural disasters, **socioeconomic status**, and the built (i.e., human-made) environment. Despite the many challenges of achieving good health, individuals do have a significant amount of control over their health and well-being. For example, becoming more physically active and eating healthy foods are two simple steps within almost any person’s grasp that have immediate benefits toward improving overall health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a).

Whether or not individuals choose to engage in healthy habits is still a personal decision. However, helping individuals start and motivating clients to succeed are two of the most valuable and rewarding aspects of being a fitness professional. Preventive efforts, including exercise and physical activity, to reduce **morbidity **and **mortality **are underutilized around the world by virtually every segment of the population. Fitness professionals have a tremendous opportunity to make a positive impact in this area.

## Defining Health and Disease

The World Health Organization (WHO) functions as the international public health agency of the United Nations and is focused on the development and promotion of international public health and well-being efforts. The WHO can be thought of as the world’s public health department. The WHO (1948) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”

Health is not a static condition, but rather an ever-changing condition due to the human body’s continual need to adjust internal and external situations, changes in physiology, or changing environments (**Figure 1-3**) (Misselbrook, 2014). The human body is uniquely designed to respond to stress and, if necessary, make necessary changes to maintain optimal health and physiological functioning. This process is called **homeostasis**, in which the human body continually strives to maintain a relatively stable equilibrium in relation to the surrounding environment and the regular tasks it is required to perform.
