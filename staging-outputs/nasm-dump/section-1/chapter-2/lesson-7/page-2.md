### CHAPTER REVIEW

Once an individual earns a Certified Personal Trainer credential, there are a number of different options for employment, including opening a personal training studio, working with clients directly in their homes, working in a health club, or operating an online coaching business. Each choice provides a viable career option, and no matter which one is selected, it can take time to develop a clientele that provides a steady source of income. Even if a fitness professional has the goal of starting a business or opening a fitness studio, beginning a fitness career by working as an employee at a health club can help establish the foundational skills necessary for long-term success.

After earning the NASM-CPT credential, a well-crafted resume is needed to attract the necessary attention to earn an interview. A resume should be a short, one- or two-page, outlined presentation of an individual’s ability to contribute to a particular type of organization. A new Certified Personal Trainer may not have any specific experience working in the fitness industry; however, it is important to highlight other skills and job experiences that can easily transfer—specifically experience in customer service and sales. During an interview, it is most important to communicate effectively, openly, and honestly.

Whether traveling to client’s homes or working as a health club employee, fitness professionals are responsible for managing their own business, making it important to act professionally with everything they do. Client management includes doing all necessary paperwork such as reviewing assessment or intake forms; preparing invoices or paperwork and collecting payment; developing or updating exercise programs; conducting follow-up phone calls, emails, or text messages to schedule and confirm appointments; and managing any other communication relating to working with existing clients. Fitness professionals working for an employer should follow any existing guidelines for marketing through online channels or social media, while independent Certified Personal Trainers should learn how to use numerous online resources and mobile apps to market their services, communicate with clients, and even collect payments.

Once a job is earned or a new business is formed, fitness professionals should establish specific hours that they are available to see clients and adhere to this schedule for consistency. A client must understand that they are paying for an hour of time. If the client is late, the session should still end on time and not run into the next client’s session. All clients will appreciate the ability to establish and maintain a consistent schedule. This will also help avoid burnout and ensure that a healthy work–life balance is maintained.

While many fitness professionals enter the industry wanting to help people and are not interested in being sales people, the reality is that sales skills are needed to be successful and earn a living. Selling personal training services is about asking a client to make a commitment to an exercise program to improve their own health, wellness, and fitness. From that perspective, selling becomes a more comfortable process of uncovering a client’s needs and providing solutions to those needs.

Along with sales, marketing is the process of promoting a service for the purpose of communicating the features, advantages, and benefits of a service to clients. Whether working for a health club or as an independent contractor, it will be necessary to develop a marketing plan to uncover potential new clients. Health clubs often provide new members with complimentary training sessions to help Certified Personal Trainers build their clientele.
