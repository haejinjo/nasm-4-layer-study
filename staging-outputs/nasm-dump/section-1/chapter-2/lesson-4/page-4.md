# TRY THIS

Use some basic math to determine the number of personal training sessions needed per day to meet an annual income goal:

1. Set a goal for total annual income: $________

2. Divide that annual number by 50 to determine income needed to be earned per week:

Annual income goal ÷ 50 = $________ weekly income goal*

*50 is used instead of 52 to provide the fitness professional with 2 weeks of vacation per year.

3. Divide the number for the weekly income goal by the pay rate earned per training session:

Weekly income goal ÷ Per session rate = _______ number of weekly sessions needed to meet annual income goal

4. Divide the number of weekly sessions by the number of work days per week to determine how many sessions are needed each day to support the annual income goal:

Sessions per week ÷ Days of work per week = _______ number of daily sessions to meet the annual income goal

5. A common rule of thumb is that an average of 10% of initial prospects will close on a sale and convert to a client. With that in mind, multiply the number of sessions per day by 10 to uncover how many prospects need to be interacted with daily to keep the client pipeline full enough to support annual income goals:

Sessions per day × 10 = ______ number of prospects to interact with each work day

Health clubs typically offer preset packages of personal training sessions or a monthly subscription that provides a specific number of personal training sessions for a flat fee. For example, a health club may offer a prepaid package of 20, one-hour personal training sessions, or it could offer 4 sessions per month for a monthly subscription fee. The subscription model is becoming increasingly popular due to the affordability it provides. Only the most affluent of clients will be able to pay for large training packages up front, so a smaller monthly fee can be much more comfortable to budget for.

Fitness professionals working for themselves or as independent contractors will need to decide how to structure the services they want to sell. Because of this, considerable research needs to be performed to uncover competitor rates in the surrounding area. If numerous competing facilities charge similar rates, independent fitness professionals need to set their rates accordingly while still remaining competitive.

When asking for the sale, fitness professionals should present all of the available price points and allow potential clients a little time to receive the information. Clients need to be the one to choose the program that works best for them so that they feel empowered in the decision- making process. Some input can be provided to help guide their decision, such as, “If we meet two times a week, I feel comfortable I can help you meet your goal in 10 weeks. But if we meet three days per week, you will be able to reach your goal even faster!” This educates clients about prices and expectations for results. It is perfectly fine if a client is happy with the lowest level package, because once a client is signed, every training becomes an opportunity to keep building rapport, demonstrating professionalism, and tracking the client’s progress.
