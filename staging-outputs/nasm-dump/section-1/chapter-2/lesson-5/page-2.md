## Content
Many health clubs will have dedicated marketing departments that handle most of this effort; however, even in the biggest commercial health clubs, all fitness professionals are still responsible for building and maintaining their own clientele. Whether working for a health club or as an independent contractor, it will be necessary to at least develop a personal marketing plan to communicate with potential clients and help bring them into the gym. Fitness professionals just starting their career should realize that it could take as long as 3 to 6 months of work to develop a full client schedule.

For fitness professionals in charge of promoting their own services, their marketing should solve a problem; specifically, it should tell a story about how a service (or product) can enhance customersâ€™ lives. Marketing should communicate the benefits of working with a Certified Personal Trainer to help potential clients meet their health and fitness goals. For example, if a Certified Personal Trainer is working in a suburban location with a large percentage of stay-at-home parents or older adults, then the Certified Personal Trainer needs to determine effective methods of communicating with those specific audiences. In this case, a Certified Personal Trainer with the experience of being a parent could market to the stay-at-home parents, whereas another with specific education in working with special populations could focus on working with older adults. Just as prospecting requires the uncovering of individual fitness needs, greater marketing efforts for the independent fitness professional need to uncover and solve for fitness needs of an entire community and surrounding population.

It might be helpful for a fitness professional to identify their **unique selling proposition (USP)**. A USP could be traits or skills that allow one fitness professional to stand out from others by featuring services that are unique or different. When high-intensity workout programs were first introduced, the USP was that doing extreme workouts in a short period of time was a different way to exercise that produced results not offered by other methods. Examples of USPs that a fitness professional might use include:

	- Specializing in working with active adults aged 55 years and older

	- Focusing on weight-loss clients to help them learn how to use physical activity for long-term health and body composition improvement

	- Training athletes to improve their sport-specific performance

#### TRY THIS

**Coaching Group Workouts **

Teaching group fitness classes can be an effective marketing tactic for a Certified Personal Trainer. It allows for the promotion of personal training services to a group of consumers who are already committed to achieving results. Earning an additional certification as a group fitness instructor can open an entire new world of potential clients.

### BUILDING VALUE AND A BRAND

A **brand** tells a story and creates an identity for a product or service (Ries & Ries, 2004). The value of creating a brand identity is that it establishes a top-of-mind presence, which means that a specific brand name immediately comes to mind when a consumer thinks about a generic product category. A fitness professional can create a brand featuring a style of program design, such as body building or endurance training, or build a brand around a category of equipment, like training specifically with kettlebells.
