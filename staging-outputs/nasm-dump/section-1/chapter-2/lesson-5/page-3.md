## Content
As most sales are based on emotional decision-making, creating a brand to define the quality of personal training services that a client can expect is an important step in establishing an emotional connection with a client. A Certified Personal Trainer who invests the time to develop a specific brand for their service can help prepare clients for what to expect during the personal training experience.

#### TRY THIS

Identify your favorite brands of fitness programs or products that are currently popular and think about how each brand identity helps improve the popularity of the product.

Besides working with a specific type of clientele or type of equipment, another way to establish a brand is through personality or the specific method by which the workout experience is delivered. There are key differences, for example, between a drill instructor-type fitness professional who barks no-nonsense orders and someone who is more nurturing and supportive of everyone’s emotional needs. There are plenty of people who enjoy each, creating the opportunity for a fitness professional to build a brand that is directly tied to their own unique personality and coaching style. One Certified Personal Trainer may establish a brand of being the toughest workout in the city, while another fitness professional establishes a brand where even the most deconditioned individuals feel welcomed. Regardless of which type of brand is selected, one of the most effective methods of establishing a brand identity is by simply delivering on the promise of service.

### USING A SWOT ANALYSIS TO BUILD A BRAND

To develop a full schedule, fitness professionals should take the time to identify a specific group of potential clients who can benefit from their personal training services (target demographic). A **SWOT analysis** can be used to identify areas of strength that can be used for building a brand and establishing a USP while also identifying opportunities for professional growth and development. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats:

	- **Strengths**

Identify the strengths and competitive advantages including education, skills, abilities, or work experience with a specific population. Examples of strengths might be education, certifications earned; the name or location of employer, which itself may have a strong brand identity; or experience working with a particular type of client. The strengths can ultimately help identify the professional traits to develop a brand identity.

	- **Weaknesses**

Identify any and all weaknesses; be honest and thorough, the more honestly a fitness professional can assess their weakness, the more opportunities for growth can be identified. Examples of weaknesses might be unfamiliarity with specific types of clients such as elite athletes, being uncomfortable with the sales process, or overall lack of fitness industry experience.

	- **Opportunities**

Identify the opportunities for developing new professional skills or expanding into new business opportunities, such as being able to coach group workout programs. Weaknesses can be turned into opportunities; for example, the lack of education in a specific area of exercise science is actually an opportunity to take a continuing education workshop to gain the necessary knowledge to work with a specific type of client.

	- **Threats**

Identify all of the threats that might impact a fitness professional’s business. Examples of threats are the general economic climate, the number of other fitness professionals working in a health club, or competitors who plan on growing or expanding into the marketplace. In some cases, threats are due to external forces that cannot be controlled (such as an economic recession), while in other cases they can be turned into opportunities for new business.
