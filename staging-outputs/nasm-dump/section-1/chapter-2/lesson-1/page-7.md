### ONLINE FITNESS COACHING

There are numerous fitness consumers who are motivated to exercise on their own, but they need the guidance of a fitness professional to know what to do. This creates the perfect opportunity for online coaching programs. Online coaching is a completely new business model of delivering personal fitness services that has evolved over the past decade.

Just like in-person personal training, different models exist for how online fitness coaching can be delivered to clients. Two of the most common models include selling predesigned workout programs or offering personalized workouts based on specific needs.

Some online coaches will meet with and coach clients through workouts using a camera-based app, while other online coaches may simply create a number of preformatted programs and market them through a social media channel. Additionally, some fitness professionals may provide a hybrid service where they meet with a client in person to conduct an assessment and design the initial exercise program but then may provide ongoing coaching and program maintenance remotely through an online platform. This hybrid model, specifically, can be leveraged by all working fitness professionals to maintain consistent interaction with clients who do not purchase multiday-per-week training packages, helping to boost accountability and **adherence** to the program.

#### TRAINING TIP

Certified Personal Trainers have a lot in common with stock brokers and real estate agents. Once an individual earns a license to sell stocks or real estate, it is merely the foundation of their career—it is up to the individual broker or agent to generate all of their own respective business. Earning the NASM personal training credential is a foundational step of a possibility-rich career. However, it is up to each individual fitness professional to generate their own book of business for long-term success, no matter which employment model is selected.
