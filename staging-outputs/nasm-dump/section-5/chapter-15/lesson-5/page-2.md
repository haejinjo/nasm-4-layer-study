## Content
- Treadmill speed should be kept to a controllable pace to avoid overstriding. The hips may not be able to properly extend and may cause the low-back to overextend (arch), placing increased stress on the low-back. Flexibility for the hip flexors should be emphasized before and after use, along with strengthening exercises for the core and gluteal complex.

## Adducted and Internally Rotated Knees and Pronated Feet 

Individuals with this posture must be careful not to exacerbate faulty lower extremity moveÂ­ments, such as knee valgus (knock-knees). Knee valgus is a predictive factor for knee injury (Numata et al., 2017; Padua et al., 2012). The fitness professional must keep the following factors in mind:

	- Cardiorespiratory exercise that involves the lower extremities requires proper mobility at the ankle joint. Emphasize self-myofascial techniques and stretching for the calves, adductors, and hip flexors. Additional strengthening exercises for the gluteus medius and maximus are also recommended (Powers, 2010).

	- Using the treadmill and steppers that require climbing may initially be too extreme for constant repetition if clients are allowed to hold onto the rails and speed up the pace. If these modalities are used, emphasize the flexibility exercises mentioned previously and keep the pace at a controllable speed until these postures are corrected.
