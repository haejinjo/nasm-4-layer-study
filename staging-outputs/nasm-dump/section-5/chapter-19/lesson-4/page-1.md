# SUMMARY

SAQ training is broken down into three components; speed, agility, and quickness. Speed is the velocity of movement in a given direction. Agility is the ability to sprint in multiple directions (running and cutting) while maintaining postural control and oftentimes requires reacting to a stimulus. Quickness refers to the ability to react to a stimulus (i.e., reaction time) and appropriately change the motion of the body in response to that stimulus. SAQ exercises can be beneficial for many nonathletic populations by improving fitness and incorporating variety into a training plan. These exercises present the body and mind with various challenges that promote improvements in functional movement, flexibility, reaction time, and even cardiovascular fitness. These challenges can promote improvements in physical performance and sustain youthful movement throughout life. The ability to react quickly, control the body through coordinated movement patterns, and change directions under control and with speed will enable clients to participate in recreational activities throughout life in a playful and safe manner.
