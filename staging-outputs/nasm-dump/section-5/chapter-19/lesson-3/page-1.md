# SAQ Drills and Programming Strategies

SAQ exercises should be integrated carefully into a client’s overall training program. It should be emphasized that the programming guidelines presented in **Table 19-3** are only meant to be suggestions and should be gauged on the total volume of training for all components (cardio, core, balance, plyometric, and resistance) in a workout. As the demands for movement speed and reactivity increase, so do the risks of injury. The safety and success of an SAQ program is dependent on the physical capabilities and fitness level of the client. The better a fitness professional can match drills appropriate to a client’s capabilities, the safer and more effective the program will be. All exercises should be performed with precise technique to minimize risk of injury.

**TABLE 19-3 SAQ Program Design for Apparently Healthy Adults**

| Client Experience Level | SAQ Exercise | Sets | Reps | Rest |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Beginner | 4–6 drills with limited inertia and unpredictability, such as Cone Shuffles and Agility Ladder Drills | 1–2 | 2–3 | 15–60 seconds |
| Intermediate | 6–8 drills allowing greater horizontal inertia but limited unpredictability, such as 5-10-5, T-Drill, Box Drill, and Stand-Up to Figure 8 | 3–4 | 3–5 | 0–60 seconds |
| Advanced | 6–10 drills allowing maximal inertia and unpredictability, such as Modified Box Drill, Partner Mirror Drill, and timed drills | 3–5 | 3–5 | 0–90 seconds |
