## Content
## Core Musculature

Certified Personal Trainers must have a basic understanding of functional anatomy to understand the principles of core training. The **core**, also known as the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex (LPHC), includes a space within the body that has the following boundaries: diaphragm superiorly, abdominal muscle anteriorly and laterally, lumbar spine and gluteal muscles posteriorly, and pelvic floor and hip musculature inferiorly (Huxel Bliven & Anderson, 2013). In simpler terms, the core region is at the body’s center of gravity and includes (but is not limited to) the abdominals, hips, gluteal complex, and low-back area. The core musculature can be divided into two unique categories: the local muscles and the global muscles (**Figures 16-1** and **16-2**). To maintain optimal stability and function of the core, it is important to systematically condition all muscles of the core. Together, the local and global muscles work to stabilize the spine while producing efficient arm and leg movements. These muscles work together to produce strong, effective movements of the trunk while continuing to stabilize the spine. Optimal lengths of muscles (or length-tension relationships) and recruitment of muscles (or force-couple relationships) of the LPHC, along with coordinated joint motions, are important for producing effective and efficient movements. **Table 16-1** provides examples of local and global muscles of the core (this is not an exhaustive list).

**TABLE 16-1 Examples of Local and Global Core Muscles**

| Examples of Local Muscles | Primary Actions | Image |
|---|---|---|
| Rotatores | Stabilize and rotate spinal segments |  |
| Multifidus | Stabilize, extend, and rotate spine |  |
| Transverse abdominis | Increase intra-abdominal pressure |  |
| Diaphragm | Regulate inspiration |  |
