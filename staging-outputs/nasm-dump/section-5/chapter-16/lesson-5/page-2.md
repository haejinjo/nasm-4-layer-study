### CHAPTER REVIEW

A core training program is designed to increase stabilization, strength, muscle endurance, and power of the LPHC. Core training is a fundamental part of a training regimen, which is critical for achieving a wide range of health and fitness goals, including improving posture, enhancing performance, increasing injury resistance, and augmenting injury rehabilitation. Core muscle strengthening has been found to improve spinal alignment, which is important for ensuring proper tension of muscles not only during dynamic exercise movements but also in activities of daily living. A strong and stable core is important for generating strong and explosive movements needed for optimal physical performance. Core training may improve injury resistance, as core muscle training has been found to improve balance, and is important for optimizing lower extremity biomechanics that may decrease the risk of knee injury. LBP is a common cause of disability, and core exercise is effective in improving pain and function in those with LBP.

The drawing-in maneuver has been used as an effective exercise to increase pelvic stabilization and transverse abdominis activation, which makes the drawing-in maneuver critical for activating local core muscles. Furthermore, activating the global core muscles using the bracing technique is beneficial for those with LBP. While the drawing-in maneuver and the bracing technique are critical for teaching individuals to activate their core musculature, many different exercises outlined in this chapter can be effective for improving core stability, endurance, strength, and power. It is important for a comprehensive core training program to be systematic, progressive, and functional, and emphasize a variety of isometric, concentric, and eccentric muscle actions.

#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

	- Core training is critical for improving posture, enhancing performance, increasing injury resistance, and accelerating injury rehabilitation.

	- The core is defined by the structures that make up the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex (LPHC) and includes the global and local core musculature.

	- Local core muscles generally attach on or near the vertebrae. Local muscles provide dynamic control of the spinal segments, limiting excessive compression, shear, and rotational forces between spinal segments.

	- Global core muscles are more superficial on the trunk. Global muscles act to move the trunk, transfer loads between the upper and lower extremities, and provide stability of the spine by stabilizing multiple segments together as functional units.

	- When designing a core training program, the local and global muscles should both be trained to develop proper core stability and overall movement efficiency.

	- Core strength is imperative for maintaining the natural curvatures of the spine, both at rest and during movement.
