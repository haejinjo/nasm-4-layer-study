## Content
The degree of adaptation applied during training is directly related to the mechanical, neuromuscular, and metabolic specificity of the training program (Evans, 2019). To effectively achieve program goals for clients, fitness professionals need to consistently evaluate and manipulate exercise routines to meet training goals.

	- **Mechanical specificity** refers to the weight and movements placed on the body (Schoenfeld, 2011). For example, the development of muscular endurance of the legs requires light weights and high repetitions when performing leg-related exercises. To develop maximal strength in the chest, the fitness professional must include the use of heavy weights during chest-related exercises.

	- **Neuromuscular specificity** refers to the speed of contraction and exercise selection (Duchateau et al., 2006; Gabriel et al., 2006). To develop higher levels of stability while pushing, chest exercises will need to be performed with controlled, unstable exercises and at slower speeds (**Figure 20-2**). To develop higher levels of strength, exercises should be performed in more stable environments with heavier loads to place more of an emphasis on strengthening the prime movers (**Figure 20-3**). Low-weight, high-velocity movements can develop higher levels of power (**Figure 20-4**).

	- **Metabolic specificity** refers to the energy demand placed on the body. To develop aerobic endurance, resistance training will require prolonged bouts of exercise, with minimal rest periods between sets. Endurance training primarily uses aerobic pathways to supply energy for the body. To develop maximal strength or power, resistance training programs require longer rest periods to replenish **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**, so the intensity of each exercise can remain high. Energy will be supplied primarily via the anaerobic pathways (Duchateau et al., 2006; Gabriel et al., 2006).

## Key Terms

**Mechanical specificity**
Refers to the weight and movements placed on the body.

**Neuromuscular specificity**
Refers to the speed of contraction and exercise selection.
