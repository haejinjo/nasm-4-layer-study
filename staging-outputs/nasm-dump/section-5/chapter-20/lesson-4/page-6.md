## The Split-Routine System

A split-routine system involves breaking up the body into parts to be trained on separate days. Many bodybuilders and mass-dominant and strength athletes (American football, shot put, etc.) use the split-routine system. Bodybuilders typically perform numerous exercises on the same day for the same body part to bring about optimal muscular hypertrophy. By breaking up the body into parts that can be trained on different days, more work can be performed for the allotted time per workout, which can increase muscular hypertrophy (Schoenfeld et al., 2015). Examples of several different split routines are shown in **Table 20-7**. Any variation of theseÂ outlined routines can be used, but the important issue in some of these routines is recovery time. When training each body part more than once per week, fitness professionals should account for volume and intensity.
