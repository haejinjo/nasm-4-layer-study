	<li>Benefits of flexibility training include increased joint ROM, possible decrease in muscle soreness, and a potential reduction in injury risk.</li>
	<li>Benefits of cardiorespiratory training include decreased heart rate and blood pressure while increasing stroke volume and cardiac output.</li>
	<li>Benefits of core training include enhanced posture; better bodily function for daily living; increased balance, stabilization and coordination of the kinetic chain; minimized low-back pain; and improved skill-related movements.</li>
	<li>Benefits of balance training include reducing risk of falls and ankle sprains while improving proprioception and agility-based activities.</li>
	<li>Benefits of plyometric (reactive) training include improved bone mineral density and soft tissue strength, expression of power and explosiveness, while also increasing metabolic expenditure required for weight management.</li>
	<li>Benefits of SAQ training include improved top speed, change in direction, and rate of acceleration and deceleration.</li>
	<li>Benefits of resistance training include increased endurance, strength, and power; muscular hypertrophy; and weight management.</li>
	<li>The OPT model is based on the scientific rationale of human movement science and uses the principles of integrated training.</li>
	<li>The OPT model is divided into three different levels of training: stabilization, strength, and power, which are subdivided into five phases.</li>
	<li>Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training is designed to teach optimal movement patterns (e.g., pushing, pulling, pressing, squatting, hip hinging) and core and joint stability, and helps clients become familiar with various modes of exercise.</li>
	<li>The goal of Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training is to enhance stabilization endurance while increasing prime mover strength.</li>
	<li>Phase 3 Muscular Development Training is designed for individuals who have the goal of maximal muscle growth or altered body composition (i.e., fat loss).</li>
	<li>Phase 4 Maximal Strength Training works toward the goal of maximal prime mover strength by lifting heavy loads.</li>
	<li>The goal of Phase 5 Power Training is to increase maximal strength and rate of force production.</li>
