It is an all-inclusive approach to exercise that can lead to improvements in overall health, wellness, and athletic performance.</p>

According to DiStefano et al. (2013), integrated training programs incorporating different types of training in a multiplanar fashion are more optimal than isolated resistance training programs. Areas of improvement were found in movement quality, speed and agility, strength, endurance, flexibility, and power. This does not mean that isolated training is ineffective, but when the fitness professional intends to provide the greatest changes to their clients, integrated training improves more variables than isolated training. Research has indicated that a multidimensional, or integrated, training approach can provide a greater effectiveness to an exercise program than an isolated resistance program (Reilly et al., 2009). This indicates that if the fitness professional implements an integrated approach, the client can benefit to a higher extent by incorporating more variables aimed at creating specific results based on client goals, needs, and abilities.</p>

Additional principles that must be observed include training in a systematic and progressive fashion, training fundamental movement patterns, training with optimal posture, training for optimal range of motion, training in all planes and motion, manipulating acute variables (e.g., sets, reps, and rest periods), and designing exercise programs based on assessment results.</p>
