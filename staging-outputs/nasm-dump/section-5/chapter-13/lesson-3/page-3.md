## Content
Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training not only addresses the existing structural deficiencies, it may also provide a superior way to alter body composition (reduce body fat) because all the exercises can be performed in a circuit fashion, using short rest periods along with a high number of repetitions. By performing exercises in a controlled yet unstable environment, the body is forced to recruit more muscles to stabilize itself.Â In doing so, more calories are potentially expended, especially when performed in succession with minimal rest (Lagally et al., 2009; Ogita et al., 2000).

## Strength

The emphasis of the strength level of training in the OPT model is to maintain stabilization endurance while increasing overall muscular strength. This is also the level of training to which an individual will progress if their goals are hypertrophy (increasing muscle size) or maximal strength (lifting heavy loads). The strength level in the OPT model consists of three phases: Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training, Phase 3 Muscular Development Training, and Phase 4 Maximal Strength Training.

### PHASE 2 STRENGTH ENDURANCE TRAINING

In Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training, the goal is to enhance stabilization endurance while increasing prime mover strength. These two adaptations are accomplished by performing two exercises in a **superset **sequence, back-to-back without rest, with similar joint dynamics (**Table 13-9**). The first exercise is a traditional strength exercise performed in a stable environment (such as a bench press), whereas the second exercise is a stabilization-focused exercise performed in a less stable (yet controllable) environment (such as a stability ball push-up). The principle behind this method is to predominantly work the prime movers in the first exercise to elicit prime mover strength. This is immediately followed with an exercise that challenges stability and postural control. This produces an increase in muscular endurance, joint stability, and ideal posture.
