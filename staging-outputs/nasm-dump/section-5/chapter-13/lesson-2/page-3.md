## Content
Balance training can be very beneficial for the general population, experienced exercisers, and even highly skilled athletes. Refer to **Table 13-5** for benefits regarding balance training.

**TABLE 13-5 Benefits of Balance Training**

| Reduced risk of falls
	Reduced risk of ankle sprains
	Improvements in landing mechanics (which may reduce risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury)
	Improvements in lower-extremity muscular strength
	Improvements in proprioception and body awareness
	Improvements in agility-based outcomes in athletes
	Stronger hip musculature (e.g., gluteal complex) and lower extremities |

## Plyometric (Reactive) Training

Plyometric training is also known as reactive or jump training. A fallacy exists that plyometric exercises are only appropriate for athletes. However, plyometric training can be a safe and effective mode of exercise for many populations, since it is a form of exercise characterized by the expression of muscular power (Mansur et al., 2018). Yet, variations of plyometric training exist to accommodate clients of differing skill and fitness levels.

Plyometric training does not require many exercises or a high amount of volume, especially if it is completed prior to a resistance training session. In addition, a plyometric training session may be completed on different days in which the volume and amount of exercises can be increased for a greater stimulus. Plyometric exercise improves the **stretch-shortening cycle**, which enhances a client’s ability to move explosively (Ramirez-Campillo, 2015). Refer to **Table 13-6** for benefits regarding plyometric training.

**TABLE 13-6 Benefits of Plyometric Training**

| Increased bone mineral density and decreased risk of bone/joint injuries
	Improved soft tissue (ligaments, tendons, cartilage) strength and decreased risk of injury
	Increased metabolic expenditure for improved weight management and/or weight loss
	Increased strength and power for athletes and general population
	Improved muscle contractions and nervous system synchronization
	Improved performance or game play for athletes of all levels |

## Speed, Agility, and Quickness Training

Speed, agility, and quickness (SAQ) training is another form of exercise that can be misconstrued as something fit just for athletic purposes. Like plyometrics, these drills can all be modified to be beneficial for most types of clients.

## Key Terms

**Proprioception**
The body’s ability to naturally sense its general orientation and relative position of its parts.

**Stretch-shortening cycle**
Loading of a muscle eccentrically to prepare it for a rapid concentric contraction.
