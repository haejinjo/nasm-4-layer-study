# Active Stretching

**Active stretching** is the process of using agonists and synergists to dynamically move the joint into a ROM (Vernetta-Santana et al., 2015). This form of stretching increases motor neuron excitability, creating reciprocal inhibition of the muscle being stretched (Kenney et al., 2019). The active supine hamstring stretch is a good example of active stretching. The quadriceps extend the knee. This enhances the stretch of the hamstrings in two ways. First, it increases the length of the hamstrings. Second, the contraction of the quadriceps causes reciprocal inhibition (decreased neural drive and muscle spindle excitation) of the hamstring complex, which allows it to elongate (Vernetta-Santana et al., 2015). Active stretches are suggested for pre-activity warm-up, such as before sports competition or high-intensity exercise. If an individual possesses muscle imbalances, active stretching should be performed after self-myofascial techniques and static stretching for muscles determined as overactive during the assessment process. Typically, 5 to 10 repetitions of each stretch are performed and held for 1 to 2 seconds each (**Table 14-6**). Detailed explanations of various active-isolated techniques are described in the following section.

**TABLE 14-6 Active Stretching Summary**

| Type of Stretch | Mechanism of Action | Training Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Active stretch | Reciprocal inhibition | 1–3 sets

Hold each stretch for 1–2 seconds and repeat for 5–10 repetitions |

#### HELPFUL HINT

Static and active stretches typically require the same body position and movement patterns. However, static stretches involve holding each stretch for 30 seconds, whereas active stretches require holding the stretch for only 1 to 2 seconds and repeating the motion for 5 to 10 repetitions. Active stretching can be considered a progression from static stretching.

## Active Stretches

### Active Gastrocnemius Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Stand with back hip and knee straight (target leg). The opposite hip and knee are flexed and swing back and forth across the body. This motion causes rotation at the back knee and eversion and inversion of the foot and ankle. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Key Terms

**Active stretching**
A type of stretching that uses agonists and synergists to dynamically move the joint into a range of motion; includes holding the stretched position for 1–2 seconds and repeating for 5–10 repetitions.
