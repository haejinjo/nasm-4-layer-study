## What Is Plyometric Training?

The ability to generate force as quickly as possible is known as **rate of force production** (Maffiuletti et al., 2016). Success in everyday activities and sport depends on the speed at which muscular force is generated. Research demonstrates that resistance training combined with plyometric exercises significantly increase muscle force production, facilitating increases in strength and power (Mckinlay et al., 2018; Oxfeldt et al., 2019; Peitz et al., 2018).

Plyometric training involves exercises that generate quick, powerful movements involving an explosive concentric muscle contraction preceded by an eccentric muscle action (Slimani et al., 2016). In other words, there is a “cocking” or loading phase described as an eccentric muscle action that dampens or slows the downward movement of the body (deceleration) followed immediately by an explosive concentric muscle contraction (Slimani et al., 2016).

These types of explosive muscular contractions can be seen in practical instances, such as rebounding a basketball. Trained basketball players prepare to jump up for a loose ball by lowering their body slightly by flexing at the ankles, knees, and hips; this is eccentric loading. Players may even drop their arms to assist in takeoff. At a fairly shallow point, players will reverse this downward motion and rapidly project themselves up from the ground extending their ankles, knees, hips, and arms upward, which is the concentric contraction. The overall height of their jump is determined by their vertical velocity, or how fast they leave the ground.

This is the essence of a plyometric exercise and uses a characteristic of muscle known as the **stretch-shortening cycle**. The stretch-shortening cycle improves the elastic properties of connective tissue and muscle fibers by enhancing stored elastic energy through the eccentric phase and releasing it during the concentric phase to increase force production. (Slimani et al., 2016). In fact, the **integrated performance paradigm** states that to move with precision, forces must be eccentrically loaded, isometrically stabilized, and then unloaded or concentrically accelerated (**Figure 18-1**).

### THREE PHASES OF PLYOMETRIC EXERCISE

There are three distinct phases of the stretch-shortening cycle involved in a plyometric exercise: the eccentric or loading phase, the amortization phase or transition phase, and the concentric or unloading phase (Chmielewski et al., 2006).

#### THE ECCENTRIC PHASE

The first phase of a plyometric movement can be classified as the eccentric phase (deceleration), which describes the preloading or stretching of the agonist muscle. During the eccentric phase, elastic energy is stored, and muscle spindles are stimulated, which sends signals to the central nervous system (Davies et al., 2015; Slimani et al., 2016).

## Key Terms

**Rate of force production**
Ability of muscles to exert maximal force output in a minimal amount of time.

**Stretch-shortening cycle**
Loading of a muscle eccentrically to prepare it for a rapid concentric contraction.

**Integrated performance paradigm**
To move with efficiency, forces must be dampened (eccentrically), stabilized (isometrically), and then accelerated (concentrically).
