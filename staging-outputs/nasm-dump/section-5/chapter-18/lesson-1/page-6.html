If exercises that are too advanced for the client are assigned to their exercise plan, they will not have the ability to perform them correctly and they will compensate. This may lead to faulty movement patterns and increased risk of injury. When placed within a well-designed programming scheme with proper progressions, plyometric training can be a vital component to achieving optimal performance of any activity at any level of ability.</p>

However, they do need stabilization, strength, and endurance as well as the ability to produce force quickly to perform daily activities efficiently. Therefore, it is imperative that both can react and produce sufficient force: for the 65-year-woman to avoid a fall or for the 25-year-old athlete to avoid an opponent. Plyometric exercises are performed with a faster tempo, similar to movements seen in daily life or sport-related activities.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enginsu et&nbsp;al. (2014) examined 36 female volleyball players who carried out a plyometric training for 12 weeks and a control group that carried out no physical training. After 12 weeks, only the plyometric training group significantly improved lower limb movement patterns. It was concluded that plyometric training improves lower limb kinematics and functional performance, suggesting the incorporation of these exercises in preventive programs for anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</li>
	<li>Franchi et&nbsp;al. (2019) concluded that plyometric exercise is an effective exercise method in counteracting the functional effects of sarcopenia (loss of muscle tissue). A training period of only 6 weeks for both young and older individuals achieved similar increases in muscle size and power through plyometric exercise.</li>
	<li>Ozbar (2015) examined 10-week plyometric training in elite female soccer players. Twenty adult players were divided into a plyometric group and a control group. Both groups performed technical and tactical training and matches together. It was found that sprint, counter-movement jump, standing broad jump, peak power, and kicking speed test values were all significantly improved in the plyometric group versus the control group. The results indicated that plyometrics can be useful to strength and conditioning coaches for improving their athleteâ€™s&nbsp;power.</li>
	<li>Vetrovsky et&nbsp;al. (2019) performed a systematic review of plyometric training and its impact on physical function for older adults. Eighteen papers were included in the review, and the authors concluded that plyometric training is a feasible and safe training option for older adults to improve performance, function, and health-related outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Plyometric training can reduce the risk of injury in competitive athletes.</li>
	<li>Plyometric training increases muscle size and limits the effects of sarcopenia.</li>
	<li>Plyometric training increases muscular power and athleticism.</li>
	<li>Plyometric training is a safe option for older adults to improve function.</li>
