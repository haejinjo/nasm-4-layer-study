## Content
The fitness professional can also tailor balance activities to be sport specific; for example, a basketball athlete can balance on one leg while passing the basketball back and forth. When incorporating balance training into an injury prevention program for athletes, ensuring activity performance in the sports environment with minimal equipment may improve compliance and overall adherence across a season.

Balance training is also beneficial for older adults. Falls are one of the leading causes of injuries and health-related complications in older adults. While both external (i.e., environmental) and internal (i.e., muscle strength) factors may influence the risk of falling, the body’s balance system plays a critical role in allowing an individual to maintain control over their own body’s placement and prevent a fall. In exercise programs that include balance training, research has shown up to a 20% reduction in the risk of falls in older healthy adults (Gillespie et al., 2012; Sherrington et al., 2008).

Balance training is a recommended intervention to be included in multifactorial training programs, which also include stretching and strengthening, for adults older than 65 years of age with a history of falling (Frankel et al., 2006; Moncada, 2011). Physical exercise interventions, including balance training that challenges posture in different positions, have been shown to reduce the number of falls in healthy older adults (Hamed et al., 2018). A comprehensive 8-week exercise program that included progressively challenging balance activities showed older adults’ improvement in both physical performance and psychological confidence (Rimland et al., 2016; Shubert et al., 2018). When working with an older adult, it is important to ask the client if they have complaints of imbalances, such as feelings of unsteadiness or fear of falling, because individuals with these perceptions show a higher rate of falls (Criter & Honaker, 2016). This information will help the fitness professional to properly incorporate balance training activities into the training plan (**Table 17-2**).

#### CRITICAL

When working with an older adult client, make sure to conduct a thorough preparticipation health screening and identify if your client is capable of performing balance training exercises. Some clients may need clearance by their healthcare provider to take part in a balance training program. Fitness professionals must ensure they are informed of any medical conditions that may influence the ability to balance, from a safety standpoint.

### REHABILITATION

Balance training has been shown to enhance rehabilitation for various individuals following lower extremity injuries, such as ankle sprains and ACL injuries. Because some clients may have decreased balance, it is imperative to understand balance and how to design a balance routine that caters to the needs of the client.
