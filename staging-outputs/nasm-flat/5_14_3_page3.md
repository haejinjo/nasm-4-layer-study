# STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Poor posture, pattern overload, and trauma can create muscle imbalances within specific muscle groups in which certain muscles become overactive or underactive. The overactive muscles should undergo some type of flexibility exercises, whereas the underactive muscles may need to be strengthened. For example, with an anteriorly rotated pelvis, often observed in the lower crossed syndrome, overactive hip flexors help create the anterior pelvic rotation, which subsequently causes lengthening of the hamstring complex. In this case, the hamstrings do not need to be stretched because they are already in a stretched position. Instead, the hip flexors need to be stretched due to their overactive stateÂ (Page et al., 2010).
