### POWER-FOCUSED EXERCISES

The last progression focuses on the adaptation of muscular power. Power-focused resistance exercises are designed to increase the rate of force production (or speed of muscle contraction). This form of training uses the adaptations of stabilization and strength acquired previously and applies them with more realistic speeds and forces that the body will encounter in everyday life and in sports.

Power training is not a common or usual practice in the fitness environment, but it has a very viable and purposeful place in a properly planned training program. Examples of power-focused resistance exercise can include (but are not limited to) explosive movements, such as medicine ball throws and explosive plyometrics (**Figure 20-14**).
