# SUMMARY

The role of a Certified Personal Trainer within the fitness and allied health industries is constantly growing. Fitness professionals need to understand the rapidly changing state of knowledge and technology relating to the field of fitness and personal training. Advances in technology and physical activityâ€“saving devices are growing at an unprecedented rate and affect almost every aspect of modern life, leading to more people becoming physically inactive. This, along with growing portion sizes and hyperpalatable foods, has created an environment where much of the greater population is either overweight or obese, with many individuals subsequently dealing with related chronic diseases. Fitness professionals, however, can help train and coach individuals in all walks of life to get more active, modify lifestyle habits, and lead happy and healthy lives.
