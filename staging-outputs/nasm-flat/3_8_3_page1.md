# Energy During Exercise

Any form of exercise can be defined by two factors: intensity and duration. These key factors are inversely related, meaning that as intensity goes up, duration must go down. **Figure 8-9** illustrates the relationship of these factors; lifting weights for very a short duration with a high intensity is illustrated at point A, running 400 meters is shown at point B, while distance running for a long duration at a lower intensity is at point C. Essentially, the more intense the effort, the shorter the possible duration of the activity will be. Identifying where an exercise is located within this relationship helps define the exercise’s predominate energy system.

At higher intensities (above VT1), carbohydrates will provide more of the energy to make ATP compared to fat because carbohydrates (glucose) can be broken down quickly via glycolysis. Lower-intensity activities (below VT1) will rely mostly on fat oxidation to provide ATP. As the exercise intensity increases to levels over VT1, the body will dynamically shift to relying more on blood glucose and stored glycogen (Romijn et al., 1993). Then, at any point in an activity when a quick burst of energy is needed, the ATP-PC system will provide a large contribution for the short, intense effort. Essentially, all three systems are in a constant state of flux, readily adapting to meet 100% of the body’s energy needs for the entire range of activity intensities.

## Metabolism During Steady-State Exercise

The bioenergetics of exercise can be indirectly measured in a laboratory using various modes of exercise (e.g., treadmill or cycle ergometer). Other physiologic functions can be measured as well, including heart rate, blood pressure, and exercise load or work output. Measurements made for the purpose of assessing exercise metabolism are typically made during periods of steady-state. **Steady-state aerobic exercise**, as the term suggests, is aerobic exercise performed at a constant pace (intensity). For example, steady-state exercise could be described as walking or jogging at a consistent pace for 1 mile.

## Key Terms

**Steady-state aerobic exercise**
Aerobic exercise that remains at a relatively constant intensity, including a stable heart rate and oxygen consumption.
