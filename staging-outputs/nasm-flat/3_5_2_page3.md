## Content
Exercise and habitual posture, therefore, have a fundamental influence on the health of the skeletal system. Incorrect exercise technique, coupled with a generally poor postural alignment, will lead to a remodeling process that may reinforce the predominating bad posture (Ailon et al., 2015).

#### TRAINING TIP

Weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, jogging, dancing, and jumping, helps strengthen bones through remodeling. Nonweight-bearing activities, such as cycling and swimming, while effective for improving endurance and cardiovascular health, do not strengthen bones as effectively as weight-bearing exercise. However, nonweight-bearing exercise may be preferred for individuals with orthopedic limitations. Consequently, fitness professionals should select exercises that best fit their clients’ needs and abilities.

### TYPES OF BONES

There are five major types of bones in the skeletal system: long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid (**Table 5-1**) (Hamill et al., 2015). The shape, size, and proportion of bone tissue determines their classification.

**TABLE 5-1 Types of Bones**

| Bone Type | Characteristic | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Long | Long, cylindrical shaft with irregular or widened ends | Humerus (i.e., the upper arm bone)
	Femur (i.e., the thigh bone) |
| Short | Similar in length and width and appear somewhat cubical in shape | Carpals of the wrist
	Tarsals of the ankle |
| Flat | Thin, protective surfaces that provide broad surfaces for muscles to attach | Scapulae (i.e., the shoulder blades)
	Sternum (i.e., the breast plate)
	Ribs |
| Irregular | Unique shape and function from all other bone types | Vertebrae (i.e., the spinal column) |
| Sesamoid | Small, often round bones embedded in a joint capsule or found in locations where a tendon passes over a joint | Patella (i.e., the kneecap) |
