## Content
**Ligaments** are fibrous tissues that connect bone to bone and provide static and dynamic stability, as well as sensory input to the nervous system that aids proprioception (**Figure 5-34**) (Hamill et al., 2015). Ligaments are primarily made up of a protein called **collagen** with varying amounts of a second protein called **elastin**. Collagen fibers are situated in a more parallel fashion to the forces that are typically placed on the ligament. Thus, they provide the ligament with the ability to withstand tension (i.e., tensile strength).

Elastin gives a ligament some flexibility or elastic recoil to withstand the bending and twisting it may have to endure (Kenney et al., 2020). Not all ligaments will have the same amount of elastin; for example, the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee contains very little elastin and is predominantly composed of collagen. Because of this, it is much better suited for resisting strong forces and makes a good stabilizing structure of the knee. Finally, it is important to note that ligaments are characterized by having poor vascularity (or blood supply), meaning that ligaments do not heal or repair very well and may be slower to adapt to stresses placed on the body, such as stress caused by exercise (Hamill et al., 2015).

## Key Terms

**Ligament**
A fibrous connective tissue that connects bone to bone.

**Collagen**
A protein found in connective tissue, muscles, and skin that provides strength and structure. It is the most abundant protein in the human body.

**Elastin**
A protein that provides elasticity to skin, tendons, ligaments, and other structures.
