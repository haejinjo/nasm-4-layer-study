#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

	- Plyometric training, also known as jump or reactive training, is a form of exercise that uses explosive movements, such as bounding, jumping, or powerful upper body movements, to develop muscular power.

	- Employing plyometric training develops efficient control and production of ground reaction forces, which can be used to project the body with a greater velocity or speed of movement.

	- Clients must possess adequate core strength, joint stability, and range of motion and must balance efficiently prior to performing explosive plyometric exercises.

	- The integrated performance paradigm states that to move with precision, forces must be loaded (eccentrically), stabilized (isometrically), and then unloaded or accelerated (concentrically).

	- The three distinct phases of the stretch-shortening cycle involved in a plyometric exercise include the eccentric or loading phase, the amortization phase or transition phase, and the concentric or unloading phase.

	- Plyometric exercises increase rate of force production (power) and motor unit recruitment.

	- Plyometric exercises should progress from simple to intermediate to advanced movements and from low intensity to moderate intensity to high intensity.

	- Intensity should be programmed based on the client’s ability to execute the movement and maintain adequate training technique. If technique is lost, the intensity should drop until proper technique is achieved.

	- Plyometric intensity describes the amount of effort or stress applied by the muscles, connective tissue, and joints during plyometric drills and by the distance covered (height of a jump).

	- Plyometric volume is expressed as the number of foot contacts, throws, or catches. An example would be the completion of three sets of five squat jumps, equating to a volume of 15.

	- A general recommendation is to allow at least 1 day between intense plyometric training sessions. At least 48 to 72 hours between sessions are the recommended guidelines when implementing plyometrics for novice individuals.

	- Since plyometric training involves jumping, bounding, and other explosive movements, it is essential to teach proper landing and rebounding mechanics.

	- As a general rule, recovery times of 60 to 120 seconds between drills should be sufficient for full recovery, but this is dictated by the client’s fitness level.

	- When introducing plyometric exercises—especially to new or beginner clients—the movements should initially involve small jumps, and clients should hold the landing position for 3–5 seconds and make any adjustments necessary to correct faulty postures before performing the next jump.

	- The next progression is to involve jumps with more amplitude and dynamic motion performed with a repetitive tempo.

	- The last progression includes exercises that are performed as fast and as explosively as possible.
