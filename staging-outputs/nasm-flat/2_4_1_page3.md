## Content
Making a good first impression is crucial for a client to see the fitness professional as both an ally and an authority in the gym. Certified Personal Trainers should have a positive attitude and strong communication and listening skills. They should help clients feel confident and competent while preserving their **autonomy** to do exercises that they enjoy, while avoiding ones they do not. A good first impression typically includes:

	- Making eye contact (if culturally accepted)

	- Introducing oneself by name and asking the client’s name

	- Smiling

	- Shaking hands with the client (if culturally accepted)

	- Remembering the client’s name and using it

	- Using positive body language

If the client has completed an online application where they supplied personal interests, such as medical history or hobbies, fitness professionals should ask about them. Clients appreciate when fitness professionals show they have invested time prior to the session to get to know them. Aside from having a positive attitude and effective communication skills, fitness professionals should work hard to exhibit the following qualities to create an inclusive environment that keeps clients coming back:

	- Look professional: neat, clean, and appropriately dressed.

	- Take time to build a trusting relationship with new clients.

	- Ensure that the client feels heard and understood.

	- Ensure the client’s safety when exercising.

	- Build community by making a client’s exercise routine a collaborative effort

## Client Expectations of the Environment

The training environment includes the actual facility as well as the people inside the facility. The training environment can either hinder or foster **intrinsic motivation**. Staff members who are friendly, caring, and supportive of clients’ goals can have a positive impact on whether a client continues to return. Therefore, the environment that Certified Personal Trainers work in reflects who they are and will ultimately determine the type of clients they attract. For this reason, the most successful health clubs work hard to create a third space environment for their members.

A **third space** is considered a special, communal space that is separate from home or work. It is a place where individuals can build relationships with others while still expressing their own sense of identity. Third spaces should elicit a playful mood, helping clients to feel like they are in a home away from home. Certified Personal Trainers should strive to do their part in making the gym or fitness studio feel like a third space for clients. Before a client joins a gym, they will likely consider the following:

	- Are there a variety of training options to choose from?

	- Is the training environment supportive?

	- Does it look like they will fit in with the club’s culture?

	- What is the cost of a membership and personal training?

	- How convenient is the location?

	- Are the facilities clean and neat?
