## Content
According to this early model, damaging agents included excessive muscular exercise, cold shock, or sublethal drug doses. However, within the context of resistance exercise, the stress placed on the body is the weight used during resistance training. This can be considered a good form of stress called *eustress*, which helps the body adapt over time and become better accustomed to resistance exercise. For adaptation to occur, over time the body must be repeatedly confronted with a stressor, or stimulus, creating the desired outcome for the response. The GAS model outlines three stages of response to stress (Cunanan et al., 2018):

	- Alarm reaction

	- Resistance development

	- Exhaustion

### ALARM REACTION STAGE

The first stage is known as the **alarm reaction stage**, which is the initial reaction to a stressor. These reactions can include fatigue, joint stiffness, or **delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)**. The alarm reaction stage typically occurs 6 to 48 hours after initial injury to the neuromuscular system (Cunanan et al., 2018). Over the course of 24 to 72 hours, when a person begins a new training routine or unaccustomed exercise, muscles may exhibit classic DOMS (Franchi et al., 2017). During this period of DOMS, any attempt at replicating or advancing the soreness-inducing exercise will be limited by the factors contributing to the soreness. It is noteworthy to mention that research indicates soreness as poorly correlated with the magnitude of muscle damage (Mike et al., 2017). Specifically, it may provide a general indication that muscle damage has occurred; however, it cannot be used as a sole determinate of the extent of muscle damage. It is important for fitness professionals to note that all types of muscle contractions and various exercise programs induce aspects of muscle damage, particularly in untrained individuals, especially when developing resistance training programs for new or beginning clients. Therefore, it is important to minimize DOMS by introducing resistance exercises in a gradual and systematic fashion.

The alarm reaction stage stimulates several physiological processes within the body, including an increase in oxygen and blood supply, neural recruitment to working muscles, bone formation, increased joint load and tolerance, and connective tissue strengthening. It is believed that if small doses of damaging stimuli were to persist, the injured organism would develop a large resistance to the stimulus, and the body’s appearance and function would return to** homeostasis**. As such, fitness professionals should apply the principle of **progressive overload** to assist the body in overcoming unaccustomed stressors (Cunanan et al., 2018).

### RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT STAGE

During the **resistance development** stage, numerous physiological changes occur that ultimately lead to training adaptations that promote increases in performance (Cunanan et al., 2018). After repeated training sessions, the human body will increase its capability to efficiently recruit muscle fibers and distribute oxygen and blood to the proper areas in the body. As previously mentioned, applying the principle of progressive overload, the body will increase its ability to meet the demands being placed on it as a response to an additional stimulus (Cunanan et al., 2018).

It is imperative that fitness professionals understand this adaptation response. However, it must be emphasized that increasing load (i.e., the amount of weight lifted) is only one example to increase the intensity of an exercise program; many additional methods are used to increase intensity, as discussed later in this chapter.
