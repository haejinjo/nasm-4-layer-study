## Content
Obesity, due to poor diet and physical inactivity, is perhaps the most challenging of the public health problems faced today. When including the amount of people who are overweight as well as those who are obese, not only have current numbers already reached unprecedented levels but the rate at which both are annually increasing in most developing regions is substantial. The global public health implications of overweight and obesity are staggering and seem to become worse every year; between 1980 and 2015, obesity rates have more than doubled in more than 70 countries, with more than 600 million adults and 100 million children now classified as obese worldwide (not including the even greater number classified as overweight) (GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators, 2017; Hruby & Hu, 2015).

But there is good news. Overweight and obesity represent the one area of public health where fitness professionals can make a significant positive impact. By coaching clients to change behaviors, get more active, and follow healthy eating guidelines, the health risks of being overweight or obese can be reduced.

Certified Personal Trainers are in a unique position to help their clients not only lose weight but also keep it off for the long term. According to a key study by the National Weight Control Registry (the largest ongoing study of people who have maintained successful weight loss in the United States), the majority of participants (90%) who reported consistently exercising an average of 1 hour per day maintained a significant weight loss over a period of several years (Ogden et al., 2012).

# CRITICAL

BMI provides the most practical measurement of overweight and obesity because it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. When analyzing large populations, BMI is both a valid and reliable tool to estimate overweight and obesity levels.

However, BMI is not a substitute for more precise, objective measurements of body fat composition when examining people on an individual basis. For example, elite athletes with very high levels of lean muscle mass can be mistakenly classified as obese by BMI alone, even though they may have very little body fat. For that reason, calculating BMI is just a starting point, and other body composition assessments should be considered with clients who are on a weight loss journey.
