# The Healthcare Continuum

The healthcare continuum (**Figure 1-8**) represents a systematic way to view the healthcare industry through various entry points (i.e., why health care is needed), types of care provided (i.e., which professional to choose), and the intended outcomes (i.e., what the individual wants to accomplish). The healthcare continuum describes the spectrum of preventive, acute (immediate), and long-term healthcare needs. For example, admittance to the emergency room for an injury would be acute care, whereas training with a fitness professional would be classified as preventive.

All in all, the healthcare continuum allows for a clear understanding of which components of health and wellness require a licensed medical provider and which ones are completely within an individual’s control. No longer is health care strictly related to going to the doctor when one is sick or injured; the modern interpretation represents a dynamic process with the goal of improving and extending total quality of life by combining professional care with elevated levels of self-care.

Certified Personal Trainers are a vital part of the healthcare continuum because they can become instrumental in people’s lives as a form of preventive care to help prevent illness or injury. Additionally, they can also help clients improve their health through exercise—after receiving a medical professional’s clearance—after experiencing injury or being diagnosed with an illness.

This makes it important for Certified Personal Trainers to network with a wide variety of allied health professionals so that any client question or concern can be referred to the right expert.
