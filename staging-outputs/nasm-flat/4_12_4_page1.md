# Performance Assessments

Performance assessments are typically used for clients looking to assess and improve athletic performance or specific fitness measures, because these assessments will measure overall strength, muscular endurance, power, and agility. However, the strength-based, performance assessments can also be used with clients who have experience with weight-lifting exercises and want to improve their strength in these movements.

To ensure these assessments are safe for clients, they should only be implemented after thorough static postural and movement assessments are completed. Further, it is important to determine if the client is ready for weighted and dynamic movements before initiating any of these assessments. Basic performance assessments include the following:

	- Push-up test

	- Bench press strength assessment

	- Squat strength assessment

	- Vertical jump

	- Long (broad) jump

	- Lower extremity functional test (LEFT)

	- 40-yard dash

	- Pro shuttle

## Push-Up Test

The **push-up test** measures muscular endurance of the upper extremities during a pushing movement. The goal is to complete as many repetitions as possible, with good form, usually for a predetermined length of time (Fielitz et al., 2016). There are a variety of methods for performing this assessment, depending on the population being tested (e.g., older adults, youths, military). Below is information for a standard 60-second push-up test for apparently healthy adults. This test can be completed prior to a workout session or as an integrated part of the actual programming.

**Push-Up Test Position**

	- The client should assume a push-up position with hands slightly outside of shoulder-width apart and elbows and knees fully extended and spine in a neutral position. If the client is not able to perform a standard push-up, the client can perform push-ups from a kneeling position.

**Push-Up Test Movement**

	- The client lowers their body to achieve 90 degrees of elbow flexion before returning to the start position. They repeat this pattern for 60 seconds or until exhaustion.

	- All repetitions completed to the appropriate depth should be counted during the 60-second testing period.

	- The client should be reassessed at regular intervals (e.g., 4 to 6 weeks) to evaluate progress.

## Bench Press Strength Assessment

The **bench press strength assessment** is designed to assess maximal strength and estimate the one-rep maximum for the bench press exercise. This test is considered an advanced assessment for strength-specific goals and, as such, may not be suitable for all clients, especially those with limited experience with resistance training. Generally speaking, Certified Personal Trainers should not perform this assessment for clients with general fitness or weight-loss goals.

## Key Terms

**Push-up test**
A performance assessment that measures muscular endurance of the upper extremities during a pushing movement.

**Bench press strength assessment**
A performance assessment designed to estimate the one-repetition maximum of the bench press exercise.
