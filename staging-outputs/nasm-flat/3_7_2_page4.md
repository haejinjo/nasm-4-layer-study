**Hip Flexion in the Sagittal Plane**

Hip flexion occurs when an individual decreases the angle between the femur (thigh bone) and the pelvis or lumbar spine. This can occur when an individual elevates the knee toward the abdomen (femoral-on-pelvic hip flexion). During this motion, the pelvis and spine are fixed while the femur rotates. Another version of hip flexion can occur when an individual bends forward from the trunk (as if touching their toes). In this instance, the pelvis and lumbar spine rotate together over a fixed femur (pelvic-on-femoral rotation).

##### HELPFUL HINT

To best remember dorsiflexion, think about the dorsal fin of a dolphin on the top side of its body. In this context, *dorsal* represents the top side of the foot and the direction it moves when the ankle flexes.

To remember plantar flexion, think about planting a garden in the ground. In this context, *plantar* represents the bottom side of the foot and the direction it moves when the ankle extends.

#### THE FRONTAL PLANE

The **frontal plane** bisects the body to create front and back halves. Frontal plane joint motion occurs around an anterior-posterior axis, like is seen at the shoulder when doing jumping jacks. Movements in the frontal plane include abduction and adduction of the limbs (relative to the trunk), lateral flexion of the spine, and eversion and inversion at the foot and ankle complex (**Figure 7-6**) (Hamill & Knutzen, 2003; Levangie et al., 2019).Â

## Key Terms

**Frontal plane**
An imaginary bisector that divides the body into front and back halves. Movement in the frontal plane includes abduction, adduction, and side-to-side motions.
