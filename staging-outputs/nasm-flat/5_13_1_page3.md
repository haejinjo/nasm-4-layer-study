## Content
**Integrated training** is a concept that combines all forms of exercise into one system: flexibility; cardiorespiratory; core; balance; plyometric; speed, agility, and quickness; and resistance training. It is an all-inclusive approach to exercise that can lead to improvements in overall health, wellness, and athletic performance.

Using integrated training principles, a Certified Personal Trainer will discover many new and exciting exercises, movements, and other variables to add to their professional toolbox. As a result, fitness professionals will be able to create customized exercise programs for their clients that provide several benefits:

	- Psychological benefits, such as stress relief, improved mood, and improved sleep

	- Physiological benefits, such as improved cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine (hormone) functionality

	- Body composition benefits, such as fat loss and increased lean muscle mass

	- Performance benefits, such as increased flexibility, endurance, strength, and power

A fitness professional can benefit a great deal from implementing integrated training with their clients because of the variety of exercises involved. According to DiStefano et al. (2013), integrated training programs incorporating different types of training in a multiplanar fashion are more optimal than isolated resistance training programs. Areas of improvement were found in movement quality, speed and agility, strength, endurance, flexibility, and power. This does not mean that isolated training is ineffective, but when the fitness professional intends to provide the greatest changes to their clients, integrated training improves more variables than isolated training. Research has indicated that a multidimensional, or integrated, training approach can provide a greater effectiveness to an exercise program than an isolated resistance program (Reilly et al., 2009). This indicates that if the fitness professional implements an integrated approach, the client can benefit to a higher extent by incorporating more variables aimed at creating specific results based on client goals, needs, and abilities.

However, it is important to note that integrated training principles involve more than a variety of exercises. Additional principles that must be observed include training in a systematic and progressive fashion, training fundamental movement patterns, training with optimal posture, training for optimal range of motion, training in all planes and motion, manipulating acute variables (e.g., sets, reps, and rest periods), and designing exercise programs based on assessment results.
