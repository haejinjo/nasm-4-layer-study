#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

	- Balance training is a critical component of an exercise program to optimize performance, improve injury resistance, and enhance injury rehabilitation.

	- Maintaining balance involves the ability of an individual to control the position of the center of gravity over the base of support.

	- Types of balance include static (stationary body position), semi-dynamic (the base supporting the body is in movement), and dynamic (ever-changing base of support) and can be manipulated to change the level of difficulty during a balance training program.

	- The balance mechanism involves three key senses:

		- Vision, which is typically used to provide information to the central nervous system about the body’s location in space

		- The vestibular senses, which are controlled by sensory receptors in the inner ear and provide the brain information about spatial orientation and the movement of the head in space

		- Somatosensation, which is the ability to feel changes in pressure on the skin, muscle length, and joint angles

	- Balance training has been shown to improve performance and reduce injury rates in athletes when incorporated into a comprehensive injury prevention program that is carried throughout the course of an athletic season.

	- Strong evidence demonstrates that balance training programs can reduce the risk of falls in healthy older adults.

	- Fitness professionals should always emphasize safety when designing a progressive balance training program, especially for clients with a history of injuries or a current injury.

	- When developing a balance training program, emphasize a safe and progressive increase in proprioceptive demand based on the client’s performance.

	- Many variables can be manipulated when designing a balance training program, including planes, range, and speed of motion, as well as the proprioceptive environment. Be cautious not to change too many variables at one time when progressing an exercise program to ensure that the client is able to demonstrate appropriate mastery at each stage.
