# Introduction to Nutrition

**Nutrition**, at a basic level, can be defined as the process of acquiring nutrients through food and/or food substances to support energy needs and cellular processes, such as growth, repair and maintenance of tissues, reproduction, digestion, and respiration (Shiel, 2018). The science of nutrition is the study of the way living creatures obtain and metabolize nutrients to support growth and cellular activities, the interaction of those nutrients within the body, and the various outcomes associated with these processes. Inadequate or imbalanced nutrition, in which excesses or deficiencies in nutrient intake exist, can have profound effects on the growth and health of a living creature. Nutrition also plays a key role related to optimizing performance in exercise and sport, as well as modifying body composition, such as the increase of lean muscle mass or the loss of body fat. Certified Personal Trainers often work with individuals on perfor- mance and body composition goals, and nutrition plays a vital role in the achievement of these goals. An understanding of basic nutrition principles can help fitness professionals guide their clients regarding the importance of good nutrition practices to complement and enhance their training program.
