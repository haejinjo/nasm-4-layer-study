## Content
Furthermore, the majority of published research on the subject has reported that both children and adolescents can gain significant levels of strength as a result of resistance training beyond that which is normally associated with growth and development (Myers et al., 2017).

Untrained children can improve their strength by an average of 30% to 40% or more after 8 weeks of progressive resistance training (Lloyd et al., 2014). Resistance training in youth has also been shown to improve motor skills, such as sprinting and jumping, body composition, and bone mineral density (Dahab & McCambridge, 2009; Lloyd et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2008). Improvements in strength and performance after a resistance training program in youth seem to be due to neural adaptations versus muscular hypertrophy. Neural adaptations include better coordination between agonist and antagonist muscles, increased motor unit recruitment, and higher neural signaling to muscles during activation (Lloyd et al., 2014).

When designing an exercise training program for a youth client, it is important to assess for any movement deficiencies using a variety of movement assessments discussed in Chapter 12. Information from the movement assessments will help the fitness professional design an individualized program. Exercise progressions should be determined based on the youth client’s maturity level, dynamic postural control (flexibility and stability), and response to training up to this point. One of the most important aspects to consider when designing and implementing exercise training programs for youth is to make it safe and fun. Recommendations for youth fitness training are presented in **Table 23: -2**.

**TABLE 23-2: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Youth Training**

| Mode | Walking, jogging, running, games, activities, sports, water activity, resistance training |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 5–7 days per week |
| Intensity | Moderate to vigorous cardiorespiratory exercise training |
| Duration | 60 minutes per day |
| Fitness Assignments | Overhead squat assessment

Push-up assessment

Cardiorespiratory assessments |
| Flexibility | Self-myofascial techniques; static, active, and dynamic stretching |
| Resistance Training | 1–2 sets of 8–12 repetitions at 40–70% intensity, 2–3 days per week

Progression of exercise programs should be reserved for mature adolescents, based on dynamic postural control and physical capabilities |
| Special Considerations | Progression for the youth population should be based on postural control and not on the amount of weight that can be used
