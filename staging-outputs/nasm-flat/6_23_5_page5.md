## Content
Rheumatoid arthritis is a joint disease in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissue (in this case, tissue in the joint or organs). This can cause an inflammatory response in multiple joints, leading to pain and stiffness. The condition is systemic and may affect both a variety of joints and organ systems. Joints most commonly affected by this condition include the hands, feet, wrists, and knees. It is usually characterized by morning stiffness, lasting more than a half hour, which can be both acute and chronic, with eventual loss of joint integrity, increased joint pain, and decreased mobility and overall functional capacity.

It is important for fitness professionals to understand the difference between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and be aware of the signs and symptoms of an acute rheumatoid arthritis exacerbation. In the presence of an arthritic flare-up, even flexibility exercises may need to be postponed (**Table 23-1: 7**).

**TABLE 23-17: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Individuals with Arthritis**

| Physiologic Considerations | Considerations for Health and Fitness, Sport, and Athletic Training |
|---|---|
| Maximal oxygen uptake and ventilatory threshold are frequently lower as a result of decreased exercise associated with pain and joint inflammation. | Multiple sessions or a circuit format, using treadmill, elliptical trainer, or arm and leg cycles, are a better alternative than higher-intensity, single-modality exercise formats.

The usual principles for aerobic exercise training apply (60–80% peak work capacity, 3–5 days per week).

Duration of exercise should be an accumulated 30 minutes, following an intermittent or circuit format, 3–5 days per week. |
| Medications may significantly influence bone and muscle health. | Incorporate functional activities in the exercise program whenever possible. |
| Tolerance to exercise may be influenced by acute arthritic flare-ups. | Awareness of the signs and symptoms that may be associated with acute arthritic flare-ups should dictate a cessation or alteration of training, and joint pain persisting for more than 1 hour should result in an altered exercise format. |
| Arthritis can result in early morning stiffness. | Avoid early morning exercise for clients with arthritis. |
| Evaluate for presence of comorbidities, particularly osteopenia and osteoporosis. | Resistance training is recommended, as tolerable, using pain as a guide.

Start with a very low number of repetitions and gradually increase to the number usually associated with improved muscular fitness (e.g.,  10–12 reps, before increasing weight, 1 set of 8–10 exercises,  2–3 days per week). |
