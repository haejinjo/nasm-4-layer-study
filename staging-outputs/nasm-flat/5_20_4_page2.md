## The Single-Set System

As the name suggests, the single-set system uses one set per exercise. It is usually recommended that single-set workouts be performed two times per week to promote sufficient development and maintenance of muscle mass (Schoenfeld, 2011; Yu et al., 2018). Although multiple-set training is promoted as being more beneficial for strength and hypertrophy gains in advanced clients, the single-set system can be beneficial, especially for beginning-level clients (Androulakis-Korakakis et al., 2019; Cunha et al., 2018; Ralston et al., 2017).

Fitness professionals are encouraged to explore the benefits and options of single-set workouts to further customize individual program design options. Single-set training systems are often negatively perceived for not providing enough stimuli for adaptation. However, when reviewing the physiology of the human body and how it operates, this notion may not be true (Garber et al., 2011). In fact, many beginning clients could follow a single-set program to allow for proper adaptive responses of the connective tissue and nervous system before engaging in more rigorous training systems. By encouraging clients to avoid lifting more than they can handle, injury can be avoided.

## The Multiple-Set System

The multiple-set system, on the other hand, consists of performing multiple numbers of sets for each exercise. The resistance (load), sets, and repetitions performed are selected according to the goals and needs of the client (Cunha et al., 2018; Ralston et al., 2017). While multiple-set training can be appropriate for both novice and advanced clients, it has been shown to be superior to single-set training for more advanced clients (Cunha et al., 2018; Ralston et al., 2017; Schoenfeld, Grgic, et al., 2017). The increased volume (sets, reps, and intensity) is necessary for further improvement but must be administered appropriately to avoid overtraining.
