## Content
### CARBOHYDRATES BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER EXERCISE

For active individuals, adequate carbohydrate intake before, during, and after prolonged and/ or intense activity can enhance training and performance, as well as facilitate recovery. Fitness professionals may wish to reinforce the importance of this with clients who are engaged in highly intense or endurance-based activities to ensure that they are maximizing the benefits of their training program. Carbohydrates consumed prior to intense and long-duration exercise may help replenish glycogen stores depleted during an overnight fast and ensure adequate fuel for performance. During activity that lasts more than an hour, the ingestion of carbohydrates can help maintain stable blood glucose levels and supply needed glucose to working muscles, because glycogen stores are being depleted. Various studies have shown that carbohydrate ingestion during endurance sports can increase performance and time to exhaustion (Currell & Jeukendrup, 2008; Patterson & Gray, 2007). After exercise, the ingestion of carbohydrates and protein can facilitate and optimize **muscle protein synthesis**, recovery, and glycogen replenishment.

For fitness professionals who work with endurance athletes and/or athletes with multiple training sessions per day, it is important to remember that training, performance, and recovery will be greatly affected by the athlete’s nutritional intake. To optimize and maximize the client’s benefits from training, fitness professionals can reinforce the importance of adequate nutrition with their clients and refer them to qualified nutrition professionals for further guidance when needed.

#### CRITICAL

Unless registered or licensed as a nutrition professional, it is outside the scope of practice for a fitness professional to prescribe specific meal plans for clients or athletes. It is in the client’s best interest, as well as a mark of professional courtesy, to respect the scope of practice of nutrition professionals by referring clients out appropriately when a greater degree of nutritional prescription is required.
