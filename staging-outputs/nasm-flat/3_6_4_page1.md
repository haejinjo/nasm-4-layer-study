# The Digestive System

The digestive system is a complex group of anatomical structures that function to allow the food we eat and liquids we consume to be digested, processed, and absorbed (used for energy) or to make additional tissue (Patricia, 2019). An understanding of the basic physiological processes that occur in the digestive system is necessary to understand the practical elements of energy, nutrition, and recovery.

## Overview of the Digestive System

The digestive system may be categorized into three functional regions: (1) the head and neck, which includes the mouth, (2) the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and (3) the lower GI tract (**Figure 6-14**). The food we eat and liquids we consume pass sequentially through the mouthÂ into the upper GI tract, mainly composed of the stomach, and ultimately into the lower GI tract and through the rectum where the unused food and liquid is discarded as solid waste (feces).
