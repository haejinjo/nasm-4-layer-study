## Content
Flexibility requires extensibility of all **soft tissue** along with acceptable bodily control. Adequate flexibility combined with joint ROM produces proper mobility of the major bodily regions (e.g., upper and lower extremities). Flexibility training requires a comprehensive approach that integrates various techniques to achieve optimal soft tissue extensibility in all planes of motion (**Table 14-1**). To better understand flexibility training, a few important concepts must first be reviewed, including the HMS, muscle imbalances, and neuromuscular efficiency.

**TABLE 14-1 Multiplanar Flexibility**

| Muscle | Image | Plane of Motion | Movement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Latissimus dorsi |  | Sagittal | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper shoulder flexion |
| Frontal | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper shoulder abduction |
| Transverse | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper external shoulder rotation |
| Biceps femoris |  | Sagittal | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper hip flexion, knee extension |
| Frontal | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper hip adduction |
| Transverse | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper hip and knee internal rotation |
| Gastrocnemius |  | Sagittal | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper dorsiflexion of ankle |
| Frontal | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper inversion of calcaneus (heel bone) |
| Transverse | Must have proper extensibility to allow for proper internal rotation of femur (thigh bone) |

## Key Terms
