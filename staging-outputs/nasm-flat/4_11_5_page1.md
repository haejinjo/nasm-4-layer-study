# Cardiorespiratory Assessments

**Cardiorespiratory fitness **also commonly referred to as cardio fitness or aerobic fitness, is often assessed to evaluate a client’s capacity for performing work (Kenney et al., 2015; Porcari et al., 2015). Knowledge of this capacity is important because it serves as a significant predictor of overall health, of one’s capacity to perform physical work, and even of longevity.

**Cardiorespiratory assessments** can use multiple formats, such as treadmill, step machine, or bicycle, and range from simple to very complex, all depending on the client’s abilities or the fitness goals that they plan to achieve.

Cardiorespiratory assessments help the fitness professional identify starting exercise intensities that are safe and effective for clients, as well as appropriate modes of cardiorespiratory exercise.
