The leading causes of death in the world today are classified as chronic diseases and conditions (**Figure 1-4**) (World Health Organization, 2018b). Coronary artery disease, a specific type of heart disease, is the leading cause of death in both men and women. While public health efforts and the availability of better medical treatments have lowered the rates of death from chronic diseases in the past few decades, the fact remains that numerous chronic diseases are highly preventable by simply living an active and healthy lifestyle. In fact, research has shown that the two overwhelmingly leading preventable causes of death in modern society are smoking tobacco and being either overweight or obese (Danaei et al., 2009) (**Figure 1-5**).
