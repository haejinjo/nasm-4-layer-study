### Tube Walking: Side to Side

#### TECHNIQUE

Place elastic tubing around the knees, maintain a quarter squat position, and sidestep for the desired number of repetitions in each direction. Make sure the knees are tracking in line with the second and third toes. Do not allow the knees to cave inward. This exercise primarily targets the hip abductors, such as the gluteus medius. The band can also be placed around the ankles (as shown) as a progression to this exercise.

### Leg Swings: Front to Back

#### TECHNIQUE

In standing position, swing one leg in a controlled pendulum fashion to the front and back, only lifting the leg as high as can safely be controlled. Keep a tall, upright posture with the abdominals drawn in during the duration of the exercise.
