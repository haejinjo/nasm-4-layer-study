# Scientific Rationale for Flexibility Training

There are two potential factors that support the need to implement flexibility training: **pattern overload** and the **cumulative injury cycle**. It is not uncommon to have clients who do repetitive tasks at work or home that lead to poor flexibility and potential injury. The fitness professional plays a key role in helping correct flexibility deficits and educate the client about the hazards of pattern overload and the risk for cumulative injury.

## Pattern Overload

Muscular imbalances have become common and prevalent in society, which are often caused by pattern overload. Pattern overload is consistently repeating the same pattern of motion, such as baseball pitching, long-distance running, and specific occupations, which with time places abnormal stresses on the body (Lamprecht & Padayachy, 2019; McDonald et al., 2019; Sugimoto et al., 2019). There are also gym members who train with the same routine repetitively, which may lead to pattern overload and place abnormal stresses on the body. Pattern overload may not necessarily be directly related to exercise. For example, a loading-dock employee who has a particularly repetitive occupation lifting and loading packages all day is prone to pattern overload. Factory, assembly line, and construction workers who repeat the same movement patterns are also susceptible to pattern overload. Even sitting for long periods of time while working on a computer is a repetitive stress (Verhagen et al., 2013).

## Cumulative Injury Cycle

It is essential for the fitness professional to understand that poor posture and repetitive, overuse movements can create dysfunction within the connective tissue of the human body (Iqbal & Alghadir, 2017). These dysfunctions can eventually lead to an injury and a repair response by the body termed the *cumulative injury cycle *(**Figure 14-12**) (Iqbal & Alghadir, 2017).

Current theory supports the idea that repetitive movements, such as long periods of poor posture, are believed to lead to tissue trauma and inflammation. Inflammation in turn activates the bodyâ€™s pain response that initiates a protective mechanism, increasing muscle tension and causing muscle spasm. These muscle spasms are not like a calf cramp.

## Key Terms

**Pattern overload**
Consistently repeating the same pattern of motion over long periods of time that can lead to dysfunction or injury.

**Cumulative injury cycle**
A cycle whereby tissue trauma will induce inflammation, muscle spasm, adhesions, altered neuromuscular control, and muscle imbalances.
