## Content
This can be accomplished with a technique known as reflective listening. **Reflective listening** involves making a best guess as to what the speaker means and stating it back to the speaker for confirmation.

Oftentimes, due to so many differences in language and dialects around the world, what a listener thinks a speaker means is up to interpretation. Reflective listening can eliminate that confusion, so the whole story is understood by all parties involved. When listening reflectively, fitness professionals make their best guess as to the meaning behind what the client is saying and restate that guess back to the client using similar words to make certain they understand what was said (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).

## Active Listening and Rapport Building

Most people think that good listening involves not talking when other people are talking, making appropriate facial gestures, and repeating back what people have said (Zenger & Folkman, 2016). **Active listening**, on the other hand, is about having an attitude of genuine interest in seeking a client’s perspective and understanding it on a deeper level. Active listening requires an individual to pay attention, suspend any internal dialogue, avoid distractions, look the speaker in the eye, and provide feedback at appropriate times.

Contrary to popular opinion, listening does not mean just sitting in silence. Interrupting a client is a bad idea; however, good listeners use certain techniques to take part in the conversation when appropriate to keep it moving in a positive direction. Active listening is one of the best ways to demonstrate care and help build a healthy rapport with someone. To be a good active listener, fitness professionals should incorporate the following techniques into their conversations with clients:

	- Asking questions

	- Reflecting

	- Summarizing

	- Affirming

	- Asking permission

### ASKING QUESTIONS

There are two primary types of questions that can be used in conversation: closed-ended and open-ended. **Closed-ended questions** (directive) can be answered with one word; typically, just a yes or a no. Although closed-ended questions can be important—such as, What’s your name?—open-ended (nondirective) questions allow clients to give more information. **Open-ended questions** require clients to think critically and to form a more complex answer. Open-ended questions are important for building collaborative relationships with a client because they invite discussion and can be used to explore the client’s own perceptions and concerns. Example open-ended questions that elicit optimism for change may include the following:

	- How might you go about making this change?

	- What challenges do you see and how can you plan to overcome them?

	- What work are you prepared to do to reach your goal?

	- What have you tried in the past to reach your fitness goal? (Miller & Rollnick, 2013)

Certified Personal Trainers should use a blend of both open- and closed-ended questions to best uncover information about their clients. For example, a fitness professional can ask a client a closed-ended question of how important beginning an exercise routine is on a scale of 1 to 10. If the client says a 5, the fitness professional can ask a follow-up open-ended question to dig deeper and find out why the client gave that response.
