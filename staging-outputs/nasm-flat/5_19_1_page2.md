# Concepts in Speed, Agility, and Quickness Training

Speed, agility, and quickness (SAQ) training is a useful and effective method of fitness training that stimulates muscular, neurological, connective tissue, and even cardiovascular fitness adaptations (Simonek et al., 2016; Young et al., 2015). SAQ exercises present the body with numerous scenarios requiring coordinated movements, reaction to various stimuli, and quick bursts of speed. These challenges can promote improvements in physical performance and sustain youthful movement throughout life. When clients are properly prepared, and SAQ training is done appropriately, it can be a valuable addition to any fitness-training regimen.

The term **speed**, as it is used throughout this text, refers to straight-ahead velocity and is measured as distance covered, then divided by time (distance ÷ time). **Agility** requires the ability to sprint in multiple directions (running and cutting) while maintaining postural control and oftentimes requires reacting to a stimulus. **Quickness** refers to the ability to react to a stimulus (i.e., reaction time) and appropriately change the motion of the body in response to that stimulus (such as hitting a baseball).

SAQ training improves a client’s ability to accelerate, decelerate, and dynamically stabilize the entire body during high-velocity movements in all planes of motion (such as running and cutting). In addition, SAQ training stimulates the nervous system to respond more efficiently to demands placed on it and enhances muscular recruitment and coordination when performed with correct mechanics (Simonek et al., 2016; Young, et al., 2015).

## Key Terms

**Speed**
The ability to move the body in one intended direction as fast as possible.

**Agility**
The ability to start (or accelerate), stop (or decelerate and stabilize), and change direction in response to a signal or stimulus quickly while maintaining postural control.

**Quickness**
The ability to react and change body position with maximal rate of force production, in all planes of motion and from all body positions, during dynamic activities.
