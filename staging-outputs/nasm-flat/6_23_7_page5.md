## Content
If the client has a diagnosis of PAD, the symptoms are likely to be accurate for intermittent claudication, although they still could be associated with deconditioning (Hamburg & Balady, 2011). The client’s physician should be consulted concerning the condition. If pain continues during exercise, the fitness professional must refer the client to a licensed physician immediately.

Although experience will improve the ability of the fitness professional to differentiate between disease and deconditioning, in many respects it does not really matter. The fitness professional should still develop a training regimen that attempts to improve physical function in the face of limiting factors (Hamburg & Balady, 2011). In the case of PAD or deconditioning, the use of an intermittent format of exercise, with rest as necessary between exercise bouts, is similar (**Table 23-2: 6**). Because PAD is associated with coronary heart disease and diabetes, fitness professionals should be aware of other existing comorbidities and be suspicious that these comorbidities may still exist, undiagnosed. Thus, physician clearance for exercise is necessary for the client with PAD.

**TABLE 23-26: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Individuals with Intermittent Claudication or PAD**

| Mode | Treadmill walking is preferred, also stationary cycling, steppers, and elliptical trainers |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 3–5 days per week working up to every day |
| Intensity | 50–85% of HRmax |
| Duration | Work up to 20–30 minutes |
| Assessment | Pushing assessment

Pulling assessment

Overhead squat assessment (if tolerated) |
| Flexibility | Static and active stretching |
| Resistance Training | A circuit-training format is recommended (e.g., 8–10 exercises, 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps per exercise, progressing up to 12–20 reps). |
| Special Considerations | Allow for sufficient rest between exercises.

Workout may start with 5–10 minutes of activity.

Slowly progress client. |

Systematic and integrated exercise programming, using the suggested assessment processes in Chapters 11 and 12, is advised. The number of repetitions for movement assessments may have to be decreased depending on the client’s abilities. It will be important to make clients feel comfortable and competent with this process to ensure compliance. Static and active stretching should be used for this population. Guidelines for self-myofascial techniques are not known at this time, and it is suggested that it not be used in this population, unless approved by a licensed physician. During resistance training, repetitions may need to start at 8 to 12 and slowly progress to 12 to 20. Exercise bouts may initially start with 5 to 10 minutes of activity and progress slowly to 20 to 30 minutes.
