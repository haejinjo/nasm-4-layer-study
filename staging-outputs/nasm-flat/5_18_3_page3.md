## Multiplanar Box Jump-Down with Stabilization

---

### TECHNIQUE

Make sure the client steps off and drops from the prescribed height when initially attempting this exercise. Jumping from the box presents different variables and levels of load or intensity of the exercise and can be used as a progression. Make sure the client lands softly and quietly on the ground to ensure proper force transmission through the tissues ofÂ the body. Do not let the client land with legs straight.
