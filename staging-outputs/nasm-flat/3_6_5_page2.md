## Content
The respiratory system collects oxygen from the environment and transports it to the bloodstream. Breathing is divided into the inspiratory phase (or inhalation) and expiratory phase (or exhalation). Inspiratory ventilation is active, whereas expiratory ventilation can be both active and passive, such as during normal breathing, when it results from the relaxation of the contracting inspiratory muscles. There are two groups of respiratory passages. The first is the conducting airways, which consist of all the structures through which air travels before entering the respiratory airways. These structures purify, humidify, and warm or cool air to match body temperature. The second group is the respiratory airways, which collect the channeled air coming from the conducting airways and allow gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, to be transferred into and out of the bloodstream.

The respiratory system gathers oxygen from the environment and processes it to be delivered to the tissues of the body. As cells use oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide, which is transported back to the heart and lungs in the deoxygenated blood, to be released through exhalation.

The usage of oxygen by the body is known as oxygen consumption. Maximal oxygen consumption is the highest rate of oxygen transportation and utilization achieved at maximal physical exertion.

Alterations in breathing patterns can directly impact the components of the human body and lead to further dysfunction. If the breathing patterns become shallow, the body uses secondary respiratory muscles more than the diaphragm, which can negatively impact posture and function. This may create excessive muscular tension, possibly resulting in headaches, lightheadedness, and dizziness. Short, shallow breaths can also lead to altered carbon dioxide and oxygen blood content, which causes feelings of anxiety. Inadequate oxygen and retention of metabolic waste within muscles can create stiff muscles and joints. If a client complains of headaches, feelings of anxiety, fatigue, poor sleep patterns, or poor circulation, refer him or her immediately to a medical professional for assistance.

The endocrine system is responsible for regulating multiple bodily functions to stabilize the body’s internal environment. Hormones produced by the endocrine system affect virtually all forms of human function and determine how the body physically and emotionally responds to stress. The endocrine system consists of host organs (known as glands), chemical messengers (or hormones), and target (or receptor) cells. Some of the major endocrine organs include the pituitary, pineal, hypothalamus, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Several other organs contain discrete areas of endocrine tissue that also produce hormones, including the pancreas, liver, and reproductive organs. Exercise programming has a significant impact on hormone secretion. Fitness professionals should become familiar with the pertinence of hormones’ response to exercise to maximize programming strategies and avoid overtraining.

The calories we consume from food and drinks rely on the digestive system. From the moment we begin feeding, our food and drinks are processed, beginning in the oral cavity. In the oral cavity, foods and drinks are broken down with aid from our tongue, teeth, saliva, and enzymes in the mouth. Food and liquids then pass further down the upper digestive tract into the esophagus and eventually to the stomach, where various enzymes and acids further process the food. Some of this chyme is absorbed and some passes through the intestines for further breakdown and absorption. Ultimately, what is not absorbed and used or stored as an energy source is eliminated as waste. This highly complex interaction of digestion requires the cooperation of both the upper and lower GI systems. These systems function via stimulation from our specific diets, fluid intake, medications, and activity levels. Inadequate dietary intake, such as reduced fiber, may in part impede digestion. It is important to note that digestive function requires the integration from both the endocrine and neural systems.
