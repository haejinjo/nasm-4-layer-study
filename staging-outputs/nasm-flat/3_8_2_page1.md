# Energy and Mechanical Work

To perform **mechanical work**, the body needs fuel, which is broken down through a series of chemical reactions to provide energy. Recall the first law of thermodynamics and how energy cannot be created or destroyed. The only way new energy enters the earth’s ecosystem is from the sun. Plants convert the sun’s energy to food and food provides animals (including humans) with energy to perform cellular and mechanical functions (Kalish et al., 2012; Maughan, 2005). Essentially, the human body is an organic machine that can turn chemical energy into mechanical work. Interestingly, about 40% of the energy released during metabolism is actually used for cellular work, such as a cell creating more molecules; the remainder is released as heat (McArdle et al., 2010). This is analogous to a car engine that uses gasoline (a chemical) to produce work and heat.

### HELPFUL HINT

ATP for the body is like gasoline for a car, in that it is the specific fuel substrate that burns best in the engine. The food we eat is like crude oil; it contains all the necessary chemical energy, but it must be processed into a form that our “engines” (mitochondria in cells) can use. Metabolism essentially represents the body’s internal “oil refinery.” It processes the “crude” input (i.e., macronutrients) into something that can be specifically used by the cells for fuel (i.e., ATP).

## Energy Systems

Adenosine triphosphate is the primary energy-providing molecule in the human body. It is a complex molecule made up of a nitrogenous base (adenine), a sugar molecule (ribose), and three phosphate groups. Specifically, the energy that the body gets from ATP is stored in the chemical bonds that hold the three phosphates together. When these chemical bonds are broken, energy from one of the phosphates is released for mechanical work (such as performing muscle contraction), leaving behind another molecule called **adenosine diphosphate (ADP) **and an extra phosphate group (**Figure 8-2**).

ADP is then left free in the cell, waiting to be converted back to ATP when enough energy substrates from food or bodily stores are available. Even though it takes numerous complicated physiological processes and chemical reactions to get there, all the useable energy from the food we eat and from stores in the body has the same end goal of making more available ATP.

## Key Terms

**Mechanical work**
The physical processes that move the body and keep it alive, such as muscle contraction.

**Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)**
A high-energy compound occurring in all cells from which adenosine triphosphate is formed.
