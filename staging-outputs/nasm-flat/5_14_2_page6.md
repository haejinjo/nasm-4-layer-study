### GOLGI TENDON ORGANS

The **Golgi tendon organ (GTO)** is located within the point where the muscle and the tendon meet (musculotendinous junction). The GTO is sensitive to changes in muscular tension and the speed (rate) of tension change (Kenney et al., 2019; Neumann, 2017) (**Figure 14-10**). When the GTO activates, it sends information to the CNS, causing the muscle to relax. Prolonged GTO stimulation provides an inhibitory action to muscle spindles (located within the same muscle). This neuromuscular reaction is called **autogenic inhibition** and occurs when the neural impulses sensing tension are greater than the impulses causing muscle contraction (Kenney et al., 2019). The GTO prevents the muscle from being placed under excessive stress, which could result in injury.

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

Improvements in joint ROM are always due to several factors:

	- Mechanical (muscle and tendon factors affecting compliance or stiffness)

	- Neural (inhibition of the central nervous system to help the muscle relax)

	- Psycho-physiological (stretch tolerance)

## Key Terms

**Golgi tendon organ (GTO)**
A specialized sensory receptor located at the point where skeletal muscle fibers insert into the tendons of skeletal muscle; sensitive to changes in muscular tension and rate of tension change.

**Autogenic inhibition**
The process by which neural impulses that sense tension are greater than the impulses that cause muscles to contract, providing an inhibitory effect to the muscle spindles.
