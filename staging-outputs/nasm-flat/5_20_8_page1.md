# Resistance Training Exercises

The following is a list of common stabilization-focused, strength-focused, and power-focused resistance training exercises. However, this is not an exhaustive list.

## Chest/Pushing Exercise Descriptions

### Push-Up

---

#### SAFETY

A common compensation that occurs when performing a push-up is arching of the low-back as the hips fall toward the ground. This is an indicator that the individual possesses underactive abdominals and the exercise must be regressed.

### Push-Up: Hands on Ball

---

#### SAFETY

If using a stability ball is too advanced, regress the exercise to a traditional floor push-up.
