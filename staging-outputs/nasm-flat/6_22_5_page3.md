## Content
Stability balls are best used with clients who demonstrate a need for increased overload of stability. As with any exercise technique, a proper progression from stable to unstable surfaces should be observed. For example, if a client can hold a plank position on a stable surface, such as the floor or bench, a stability ball can increase the intensity and difficulty of the exercise (**Figure 22-2: 6**). Moreover, because of the spherical shape of a stability ball, greater ranges of motion can occur during certain exercises, such as the stability ball crunch versus the traditional floor crunch exercise (**Figure 22-2: 7**). The contour of the ball allows users to perform crunches that go further into spinal extension than when performing this exercise on the floor, thus increasing abdominal strength through a greater range of motion (Sternlicht et al., 2007). For clients with limitations, such as low-back pain, the contouring nature of the ball allows for greater comfort and support during upright activities, most notably observed during ball wall squats (**Figure 22-2: 8**). Performing a ball wall squat can help individuals learn proper movement patterns and gain the necessary stability and strength required for squatting motions.
