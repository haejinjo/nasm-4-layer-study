### Pushing Assessment Movement (Figure 12-16)

	- The fitness professional should instruct the client to push the handles away from their body and return to the starting position.

	- The client should use a slow repetition tempo.

	- The client should perform five repetitions in a split stance, switch legs, and then perform five additional repetitions.

**Lateral View**

	- View the LPHC, shoulders, cervical spine, and head from the side. The lumbar and cervical spine should remain neutral while the shoulders stay level. Common movement impairments that may be observed include low-back arches (**Figure 12-17**), shoulder elevation (**Figure 12-18**), and head jutting forward (**Figure 12-19**).
