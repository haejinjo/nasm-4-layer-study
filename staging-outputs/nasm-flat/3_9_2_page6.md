## Content
This provides digestive enzymes with access to the peptide bonds in the proteinâ€™s primary structure so that they can start to clip these bonds and break up the polypeptide chain into smaller molecules or polypeptide fragments of dipeptides and tripeptides. Pepsin is one of the digestive enzymes that begins this process in the stomach. Polypeptide fragments are broken down further in the small intestine by pancreatic and intestinal enzymes before being absorbed through the intestinal wall and into the intestinal cell (**enterocyte**). Some amino acids, glutamine in particular, may be used by the enterocyte for fuel. The remainder exits the base of the enterocyte, enters the bloodstream, and is directed to the liver (**Figure 9-2**).

## Key Terms

**Enterocyte**
Intestinal cells that absorb nutrients.
