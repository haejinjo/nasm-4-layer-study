## Content
The information presented up to this point in the text has focused on exercise considerations for apparently healthy adults. This chapter covers important information and recommendations for assessing and designing exercise programs for clients with selected chronic health conditions or functional limitations.

While this chapter provides only a brief overview of selected chronic health conditions and functional limitations common in clients seeking personal training services, additional resources on exercise considerations for individuals with chronic health conditions and physical or functional limitations are available.â€ƒ

Participation in organized youth sports is declining in certain areas, and youths as a whole are becoming more sedentary. Some of the possible reasons for a decline in sport participation may include high costs and demands on parents, lots of travel, and concerns over injury (Merkel, 2013). Consequently, there is a significant need for increased awareness and access to fitness training for youth year-round, not just during one or more sport seasons.

The term *youth *refers to children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 20 years. Although a group of children or adolescents may be the same age, their response to exercise can vary considerably as a result of individual differences in growth, development, and physical maturation.

Published guidelines on youth fitness and exercise have previously focused on sport-specific training. However, given the increase in childhood obesity and diabetes, current youth fitness guidelines now focus on promoting healthy lifestyles and health-related physical fitness (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). Current recommendations state that children and adolescents should get 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily. Unfortunately, there is a youth physical inactivity crisis, especially in many Western countries. For example, in the United States, only 25% of youth participate in the minimum guidelines necessary for improving and maintaining overall health and well-being (Katzmarzyk et al., 2016). Children and adolescents should engage in daily aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening activities to improve their health and reduce their risk of developing chronic disease. In response to the growing problem of obesity and diabetes in children, the World Health Organization (2010), in conjunction with leading physical education and public health organizations, has developed a new statement on physical activity for children and youth. The World Health Organization (2010) recommends that children ages 5 to 17 years get 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity and exercise daily.
