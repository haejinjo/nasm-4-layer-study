## Content
To accurately program stage 3 intervals, measurements of VT1 and VT2 need to be recorded. Recall, at VT1, talking becomes challenging but not difficult for the client during aerobic activity, whereas VT2 corresponds with an individual’s inability to speak more than a word or two during exercise (Chapter 11 describes VT1 and VT2 assessments).

For example, if a client’s heart rate at VT1 is 145 bpm and their heart rate at VT2 is 165 bpm, the four training zones are calculated as follows:

	- Zone 1: Less than 145 bpm

	- Zone 2: 145–154 bpm (VT1 to midpoint)

	- Zone 3: 155–164 bpm (midpoint to VT2)

	- Zone 4: 165 bpm and higher

The **midpoint **refers to the intensity level halfway between VT1 and VT2.

A stage 3 program includes the client moving in and out of training zones 1, 2, and 3, while always staying below zone 4. A general rule of thumb is to have a modest mix of time spent in zone 1 (moderate intensity) with brief interval periods in zones 2 (hard intensity) and 3 (vigorous, very hard intensity) to minimize overtraining while simultaneously providing enough overload to challenge energy systems needed for performance adaptations.

Zone 2 and 3 intervals should be client specific based on the client’s goals, needs, and abilities, and zone 2 intervals are typically longer than zone 3 intervals because zone 3 intervals are more intense and physically demanding. Moreover, the volume of training in stage 3 should be progressive, yet in a slow and gradual fashion.

#### EXAMPLE STAGE 3 CARDIORESPIRATORY PROGRAM

Like stage 2, stage 3 exercise programs should be individualized for the client based on their unique goals, needs, and abilities. Following is one example of a stage 3 program (**Figure 15-4**):

	- Warm up in zone 1 for up to 5–10 minutes.

	- Then, increase the workload every 60 seconds until reaching zone 3. This will require a climb through zone 2, which may take a couple of minutes.

	- After pushing for another minute in zone 3, decrease the workload back to zone 2.

	- Overload the body again by performing another zone 3 interval.

	- Repeat for the desired number of intervals.

	- Cool down for 5–10 minutes.

It is vital when training at this level to rotate all three stages. There should be a low- (stage 1), medium- (stage 2), and high-intensity (stage 3) day to help minimize the risk of overtraining. The stage 1 day could be considered a recovery day following a hard stage 3 training day.

Work intervals within stage 3 should start out relatively brief, perhaps lasting 30 to 60 seconds. Once fitness and overall conditioning improve, stage 3 programs can be progressed similarly to stage 2 workouts, decreasing work-to-rest ratios and increasing the duration of high-intensity intervals. However, the frequency and duration of intervals in zones 2 and 3 should be client specific based on their goals, needs, abilities, and tolerance to intense activity.

## Key Terms

**Midpoint**
Refers to the intensity level halfway between ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1) and ventilatory threshold 2 (VT2).
