## Content
Physiologic considerations and their implications for training apparently healthy older adults are listed in **Tables 23-3 **and **23-4 **(Moore et al., 2016; Riebe et al., 2018; Thompson, 2019).

**TABLE 23-3: Physiologic and Training Considerations for Older Adults**

| Physiologic Considerations | Implications of Health and Fitness Training |
|---|---|
| Maximal oxygen uptake, maximal exercise heart rate, and measures of pulmonary (lung) function will all decrease with increasing age. | Initial exercise workloads should be low and progressed more gradually to 3–5 days per week.

Duration = 20–45 minutes

Intensity = 45–80% of VO2 peak |
| Percentage of body fat will increase, and both bone and lean body mass will decrease with increasing age. | Resistance exercise is recommended, with lower initial weights and slower progression (e.g., 1–3 sets of 8–10 exercises, 8–20 reps, session length equals 20–30 minutes). |
| Balance, walking mechanics, and neuromuscular coordination may be impaired. | Exercise modalities should be chosen and progressed to safeguard against falls.

Cardio options include stationary or recumbent cycling, aquatic exercise, or treadmill with handrail support.

Resistance options include seated machines, progressing to standing exercises. |
| There is a higher rate of both diagnosed and undetected heart disease in the elderly. | Knowledge of pulse assessment during exercise is critical, as is monitoring for chronic disease signs and symptoms. |
| Pulse irregularity is more frequent. | Consult with client’s physician or healthcare provider regarding possible exercise side effects, especially if the client is taking medication. |

**TABLE 23-4: Basic Exercise Guidelines for Older Adults**

| Mode | Stationary or recumbent cycling, aquatic exercise, or treadmill with handrail support |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 3–5 days per week of moderate-intensity activities or 3 days per week of vigorous-intensity activities |
| Intensity | 40–85% of VO2 peak |
| Duration | 30–60 minutes per day or 8- to 10-minute bouts |
| Movement
Assessment | Pushing assessment

Pulling assessment

Overhead squat (if tolerated) |
| Flexibility | Self-myofascial techniques using a handheld roller (if tolerated), static stretching, slow and controlled active or dynamic movement |
| Resistance Training | 1–3 sets of 8–20 repetitions at 40–80% intensity, 3–5 days per week

Exercise training should be progressed slowly, with an emphasis on executing ideal movement patterns and enhancing stabilization using appropriate core, balance, and resistance exercises, before moving on to more advanced forms of exercise. |
| Special Considerations | Progression should be slow, well monitored, and based on postural control.

Exercises should be progressed if possible, toward free sitting (no support) or standing.

Make sure the client is breathing in a normal manner and avoids holding their breath, as in a Valsalva maneuver.

If the client cannot tolerate self-myofascial techniques or static stretches, they can opt for slow and controlled active and dynamic stretches. |

## Key Terms

**Valsalva maneuver**
A process that involves expiring against a closed windpipe, creating additional intra-abdominal pressure and spinal stability.
