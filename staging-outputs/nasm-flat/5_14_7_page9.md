### SHOULDER STAND

The shoulder stand is another common posture from yoga and another inverted stretch (**Figure 14-20**). As with the plow, this position places high stress on the neck, shoulders, and spine. It should be avoided in patients with hypertension or any history of neck or spine injury, or if exact technique is not used.

### STRAIGHT-LEG TOE TOUCH

The straight-leg toe touch is one of the most common stretches for the hamstring complex (**Figure 14-21**). This position may place the vertebrae and the cartilage discs in the low-back under high stress. Any client or patient with a history of herniated discs or nerve pain that runs down the back of the leg should avoid this stretch. In addition, clients with poor flexibility may attempt to hyperextend the knees during this stretch, which may place high stress on the ligaments of the knee.
