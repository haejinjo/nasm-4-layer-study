# Trackers

Fitness (activity) trackers have proven to be valuable assets within the fitness industry and will likely continue to grow in popularity. Fitness trackers are electronic wearable devices that enable users to track their activity levels (**Figure 22-3: 2**) and come in many forms, such as watches, bands, rings, heart rate monitors, and pedometers. Ease of use and intrinsic motivation are key factors for continued use of fitness trackers among those who purchase them (Kim, 2104; Munson & Consolvo, 2012).

## Fitness Trackers

Prices for fitness trackers range considerably, so it is advisable for users to do their homework before deciding which product best fits their needs. Prior to purchasing a fitness tracker, users should ask the following questions:

	- What do I really want to track?

		- Steps

		- Heart rate

		- Calories

	- How much am I willing to spend?

	- What is my ultimate goal?

		- Weight loss

		- Training for an event or group activity

		- Health or medical purposes

Once these questions have been answered, it will be much easier for an individual to decide on a fitness tracker. Fitness trackers offer a variety of features as discussed in **Table 22: -5**.
