### OPTIMIZING POSTURE

The human spine demonstrates naturally occurring curvatures that alternate between **lordotic** (inward/concave) curvatures in the cervical and lumbar spine and **kyphotic** (outward/convex) curvatures in the thoracic and sacral spine (**Figure 16-3**). These spinal curvatures develop naturally as individuals move from crawling to walking. Maintenance of these spinal curvatures throughout the life span is important for proper energy distribution throughout the spine. Proper core muscle function is critical for maintaining natural spinal curvatures, which can be increased or decreased as a result of improper core muscle balance (Hongo et al., 2012). Overactivity of the hip flexors and superficial erector spinae and underactivity of the abdominals have been correlated with increased **anterior pelvic tilt** (**Figure 16-4**), which is associated with increased lumbar (low-back) lordosis (Król et al., 2017). Conversely, overactivity of the hamstrings and rectus abdominis and underactivity of the erector spinae can rotate the pelvis posteriorly, known as a **posterior pelvic tilt** (**Figure 16-5**).

## Key Terms

**Lordotic/Lordosis**
The normal curvature of the cervical and lumbar spine regions, creating a concave portion of the spine.

**Kyphotic/Kyphosis**
The normal curvature of the thoracic spine region, creating a convex portion of the spine.

**Anterior pelvic tilt**
An excessive forward rotation of the pelvis that results in greater lumbar lordosis.

**Posterior pelvic tilt**
An excessive rotation of the pelvis that results in lesser lumbar lordosis.
