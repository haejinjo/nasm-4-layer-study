#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

The components of TDEE include BMR, physical activity, and TEF.

Energy expenditure from physical activity may be further divided into **nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)**, which is energy expenditure through daily activities outside of structured exercise, and **exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT)**, which is energy expenditure through structured exercise.

An individual’s BMR is largely determined by body size and is also regulated by the thyroid hormone thyroxine, as well as many other hormones. However, EAT, NEAT, and TEF are variable and can be changed through an increase or decrease in activity and a manipulation of diet composition.

Since BMR is affected by factors such as age, height, weight, amount of muscle mass, and hormones, it will vary from individual to individual and may also change as an individual gets older. Clients may ask, Can I increase my metabolism? The answer is, yes, but to a limited degree. It is possible to increase BMR through resistance training and building muscle mass, but some studies have shown that increased muscle mass may only have a marginal effect on increasing the number of calories burned when the body is at rest (Kinucan & Kravitz, n.d.). A greater effect on overall energy expenditure may be achieved through an increase in both EAT and NEAT, and fitness professionals may wish to highlight this effect to clients. Increased muscle mass does have a positive impact, because it increases the body’s energy requirements during physical activity, which in turn increases EAT and NEAT. Rather than focusing on increasing BMR, effective weight management strategies will balance calorie intake with resistance training and other physical activity (both exercise and nonexercise activities) to achieve the desired goal.

### ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS

**Adaptive thermogenesis** can be defined as the metabolic adaptations and changes in energy expenditure, due to changes in energy intake (Camps et al., 2013). It is often used to explain the inability for many individuals to lose weight despite continued reductions in caloric intake (Rosenbaum & Leibel, 2010). Of note is the reduced energy expenditure that accompanies the weight loss, which appears to be greater than predicted. Several factors may contribute to this effect, but these appear to be primarily due to a decrease in physical activity and reduced caloric intake and/or reductions in body mass (Leibel et al., 1995; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Trexler et al., 2014). Thus, a reduction in energy expenditure may be expected with weight loss due to metabolic adaptations; this may be important to explain to clients so that they adjust energy intake and/or physical activity accordingly.

#### TRAINING TIP

As people lose weight, their energy requirements also change. In other words, individuals will typically require fewer calories to maintain their new body weight. For example, a person weighing 250 lb (113 kg) can consume a specific range of calories to maintain their body weight. But if that same individual loses weight and now weighs 175 lb (79 kg), the individual’s calorie requirement to maintain their new body weight, at the same activity level, is typically less. This is an important consideration for individuals seeking to lose weight permanently

## Key Terms

**Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)**
Energy expenditure through daily activities outside of structured exercise, such as walking, completing household chores, and taking the stairs.

**Exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT)**
The calories expended through structured exercise or training.

**Adaptive thermogenesis**
Metabolic adaptations and changes in energy expenditure as a result of changes in energy intake.
