### Static Levator Scapulae Stretch

### Static Sternocleidomastoid Stretch

#### TECHNIQUE

Grasp the top of the head with one hand and laterally flex toward the same shoulder. Rotate the head up and away as shown. Only perform this stretch to the point of mild tension. Do not allow the chin to jut forward or shoulders to shrug during this stretch.

#### CRITICAL

When assisting clients during a stretch, the fitness professional must be careful not to overstretch the muscle. Overstretching can occur if the muscle and joint are taken beyond their physiological limits. Aggressive stretching can result in tissue and joint trauma. The general signs of overstretching include but are not limited to (1) prolonged joint pain or muscle soreness lasting more than 24 hours after stretching, (2) edema (swelling) or inflammation of the involved area, and (3) excessive muscle or joint pain during the stretch. Caution needs to be taken when conducting flexibility exercises with clients who have a current or preexisting joint or muscle injury.
