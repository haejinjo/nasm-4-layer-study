## Content
However, performance assessments that cause little fatigue (e.g., vertical jump test, horizontal jump test) can be administered prior to cardio tests if sufficient rest periods are provided. If an exercise program is properly designed by the Certified Personal Trainer, the client should experience improvement in each assessment over time.

### OPPORTUNITY FOR RAPPORT BUILDING

Many clients come into the gym or training center intimidated by all the equipment and lacking knowledge about how to properly create exercise programs. They may also be fearful that they will become injured or push too hard during an exercise session. In these cases, postural, movement, and performance assessments are excellent tools for building trust and rapport with current and potential clients. These assessments, when implemented with confidence and compassion, can display a high level of expertise by the fitness professional and help a Certified Personal Trainer stand out among the competition. They also open the door for the fitness professional to discuss potential movement impairments and opportunities for improvements in posture and movement. Further, they help the fitness professional to carefully design an exercise program that is uniquely individualized for each and every client. With regular practice, these assessments will provide a roadmap for the development and execution of quality fitness programs.

### REASSESSMENT

Postural, movement, and performance assessments provide an important baseline from which to measure progress. Fitness professionals should carefully document the findings from these assessments to be referred to at a later time. Depending on the environment and client’s training schedule, it is recommended to reassess the client every month, or quarterly, to measure the progress they have gained from staying consistent with their fitness plan. The following are a few positive reasons to reassess clients on a regular basis:

	- It provides positive encouragement to clients and serves as a helpful reminder for them to continue working hard toward the goals they have set.

	- It helps clients realize how the exercise programming provided by their Certified Personal Trainer is making a difference in their fitness level, which helps foster adherence to the exercise program.

	- It provides an opportunity for fitness professionals to refine or progress exercises as their clients’ abilities improve.

## Considerations and Modifications

Due to the wide range of clients a fitness professional will work with, it is important to recognize and implement assessment modifications for certain populations with movement restrictions or safety concerns. The fitness professional should always use caution when implementing movement and performance assessments and only progress them once the client demonstrates the ability to perform advanced movements.

For example, if during the OHSA the client seems very unstable or lacking enough strength to smoothly lower and raise from the squat, it would not be a good idea to progress them to a single-leg squat. The fitness professional may instead choose to implement the pulling and pushing assessments. However, rather than requiring a narrow, split stance during the pulling and pushing assessments, it might be better to use a seated chest press or rowing machine to limit the balance challenge of the task. They key is to make sure that clients are comfortable and safe during the assessments, especially if they have any conditions that may limit full participation in the various assessments.
