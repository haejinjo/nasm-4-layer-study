### NASM CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

NASM has established a code of ethics and guidelines to protect the public and the profession. Candidates are expected and Certified Professionals are required to agree to and follow the NASM Code of Professional Conduct.

#### PROFESSIONALISM

Each Certified Professional must provide optimal professional service and demonstrate excellent client care in their practice. Each Certified Professional must:

	- Abide fully by the NASM Code of Professional Conduct; conduct themselves in a manner that merits the respect of the public, other colleagues, and NASM

	- Treat each colleague and client with the utmost respect and dignity

	- Not make false or derogatory assumptions concerning the practices of colleagues and clients

	- Use appropriate professional communication in all verbal, nonverbal, and written transactions

	- Provide and maintain an environment that ensures client safety that, at a minimum, requires that the Certified Professional must:

		- Not diagnose or treat illness or injury unless for basic first aid or if the Certified Professional is legally licensed to do so and is working in that capacity at that time

		- Not train clients with a diagnosed health condition unless the Certified Professional has been specifically trained to do so, is following procedures prescribed and supervised by a valid licensed medical professional, or is legally licensed to do so and is working in that capacity at that time

		- Not begin to train a client prior to receiving and reviewing a current health-history questionnaire signed by the client

		- Hold a current cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator certification from a NASM-approved provider at all times

	- Refer the client to the appropriate medical practitioner when, at a minimum, the Certified Professional:

		- Becomes aware of any change in the client’s health status or medication

		- Becomes aware of an undiagnosed illness, injury, or risk factor

		- Becomes aware of any unusual client pain and/or discomfort during the training session that warrants professional care, in which case the Certified Professional will immediately discontinue the session

	- Refer the client to other healthcare professionals when nutritional and supplemental advice is requested unless the Certified Professional has been specifically trained to do so or holds a credential to do so and is acting in that capacity at the time

	- Maintain a level of personal hygiene appropriate for a health and fitness setting

	- Wear clothing that is clean, modest, and professional

	- Remain in good standing and maintain current certification status by acquiring all necessary continuing education requirements

#### CONFIDENTIALITY

Each Certified Professional must respect the confidentiality of all client information. In their professional role, the Certified Professional must:

	- Protect the client’s confidentiality in conversations, advertisement, and any other arena unless otherwise agreed on by the client in writing or when necessary due to a medical occurrence or when legally required

	- Protect the interest of clients who are minors by law or unable to give voluntary consent by securing the legal permission of the appropriate third party or guardian

	- Store and dispose of client records in a secure manner
