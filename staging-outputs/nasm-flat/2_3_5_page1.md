# SUMMARY

Psychology plays a vital role in fitness and wellness. It accounts for much of the decision-making process to engage in regular exercise. There are several psychological aspects involved in deciding to lead an active lifestyle, including personal motivation, perceived barriers, social influences, and social support. Additionally, the psychological benefits resulting from exercise participation are well established, such as improved mood, better sleep, increased self-esteem and positive body image, and improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety. Certified Personal Trainers can borrow from some known psychological principles to assist clients in identifying specific motivations to participate, strategizing to overcome barriers, and identifying a social support system. Establishing exercise as a regular habit is challenging for most people, but with proper guidance and support, fitness professionals can play an important part in establishing life-long habits that promote physical and mental well-being.

### CHAPTER REVIEW

An abundance of research supports the psychological benefits of regular exercise among nearly every population. Additionally, research suggests that behavioral change is a multifaceted approach, meaning that several variables need to be considered for new exercisers. The role of psychology in fitness and wellness is strongly rooted in helping people change behaviors but also with managing long-term adherence. This includes determining why people exercise as well as reasons for abstaining. Motivation is an important component when engaging in exercise, because it will vary among clients.

Certified Personal Trainers are well positioned to assist clients in discovering their intrinsic and extrinsic motives, which may influence goal setting and program design. Another aspect of successful behavioral change is helping clients identify their barriers to exercise and provide suggestions about how to overcome them. Common barriers to exercise include lack of time, unrealistic outcome and process goals, lack of a social support system, social physique anxiety, the inconvenience of exercise, or ambivalence toward the idea of exercising. Regardless of the barrier, helping clients overcome obstacles will lead to better overall success and adherence.

Social influences on exercise behavior will also determine whether or not a client successfully participates. These social influences include family members, partners, friends, coworkers, and healthcare professionals. Instrumental support consists of the tangible things that can be done to help someone add or keep exercise in their regular routine. Emotional support includes encouragement and positive reinforcement that promotes the exercise behavior. Informational support consists of providing information that will assist the client in making appropriate decisions about exercise participation. Companionship support is when someone participates in the exercise behavior alongside the person who needs the support.
