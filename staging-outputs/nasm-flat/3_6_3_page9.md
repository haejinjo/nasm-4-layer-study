## Content
Specifically, a good night’s sleep leads to lower levels of cortisol throughout the day and early evening and increased levels of growth hormone through the night, as well as better control of the thyroid hormones and glucose metabolism (Aldabal & Bahammam, 2011; Chaput et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2010; Leproult & Cauter, 2010).

With regard to glucose metabolism, evidence suggests that individuals with impaired sleep (less than 6 hours) are more likely to develop **glucose intolerance** when compared to individuals who sleep greater than 7 hours. Furthermore, sleep has a role in muscle recovery from exercise. The effect of sleep deprivation on muscle recovery was highlighted in an investigation that required participants to perform repeated overload exercises. In the study, IGF, cortisol, and cortisol to testosterone ratios were higher among individuals who were sleep deprived when compared to those who had normal sleep levels (Dáttilo et al., 2019).
