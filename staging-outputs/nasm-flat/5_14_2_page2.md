## Muscle Imbalances

Muscle imbalances are alterations in the lengths of muscles surrounding a joint (**Figures 14-4** and **14-5**), in which some are overactive (forcing compensation to occur) and others may be underactive (allowing for the compensation to occur; Kendall et al., 2005; Page et al., 2010).

Muscle imbalance can be caused by a variety of mechanisms, which include but are not limited to the following:

	- Postural distortions

	- Repetitive movement

	- Cumulative trauma

	- Emotional duress

	- Poor training technique

	- Poor bodily control

	- Biased training patterns (Page et al., 2010; Sueki et al., 2013)

Muscle imbalances may result in altered reciprocal inhibition, synergistic dominance, and osteo- and arthrokinematic dysfunction. These imbalances can negatively affect overall functioning of the HMS and potentially lead to injury (**Figure 14-6**).
