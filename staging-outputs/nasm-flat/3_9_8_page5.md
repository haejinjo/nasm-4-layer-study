## Content
Meal frequency remains a debated issue. Some research suggests that smaller, more frequent meals in the range of 5 per day, spaced every 3 to 5 hours, may be optimal for athletes seeking to increase their caloric intake and/or promote muscle gain (Erdman et al., 2013). This structure of meal timing can facilitate the ingestion of optimal protein doses at regular intervals while minimizing potential gastrointestinal issues or discomfort that may arise with larger meals (Moore et al., 2015).

Previously, an anabolic window of 30 to 45 minutes of postresistance training was expected, during which MPS would be optimized with the immediate ingestion of protein and high-glycemic carbohydrates, to stimulate insulin release and rapid uptake of amino acids and glucose by muscle cells. The notion of an anabolic window for MPS has since been reconsidered, because the anabolic stimulus from resistance training appears to last for 24 to 48 hours posttraining (Kerksick et al., 2018). The optimal window for maximizing MPS is therefore much longer than 30 to 45 minutes; it essentially spans 24 hours or more (Kerksick et al., 2018). However, there is likely no benefit in delaying the ingestion of protein and carbohydrate posttraining, particularly if a delay compromises net protein and caloric intake, or if the athlete has multiple training sessions per day (**Table 9-23**).

**TABLE 9-23 Muscle Gain Strategies**

| Strategy | Recommendations |
|---|---|
| Adequate protein intake | Based on individual needs
	1.6–2.2 g/kg of body weight per day
	2.4 g/kg of body weight per day (if in caloric deficit) |
| Adequate caloric intake | Based on individual needs
	Surplus of 350–500 calories per day may be beneficial |
| Adequate carbohydrate intake | Based on individual needs
	4–7 g/kg per day for resistance trained athletes |
| Adequate fat intake | 20–35% of total calories as per USDA guidelines
	Preferentially from polyunsaturated (omega-3) and monounsaturated fats |

Fitness professionals working with individuals who desire to build muscle mass should reinforce the idea that muscle gain takes time. As with fat loss, adherence to training and diet will yield results, and consistency remains a key factor. Fitness professionals can enhance their clients’ training efforts for muscle gain by reinforcing the importance of adhering to the strategies listed in Table 9-23. For specific meal plans, clients should be referred to a licensed nutrition professional for guidance, as their needs will depend on both training and personal factors, such as medical history, weight history, and biochemical data.

## Sports Performance Strategies

Optimal sports performance depends on a combination of factors, including genetics, training, nutrition and hydration, and adequate recovery. This section outlines some of the key sports nutrition recommendations for athletes and active individuals engaged in high-level competition. The overview provided here is a summary of key recommendations and is not designed to be a comprehensive guide, because recommendations will vary depending on individual needs and preferences, type of sport, training volume and intensity, and training history, as well as other factors, such as medical history and lifestyle.
