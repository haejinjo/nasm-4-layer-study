## Content
Additionally, instead of simply attending as a participant, fitness professionals can often volunteer at industry events for even closer access to industry leaders. Working at an event also provides numerous learning opportunities without having to pay the expensive event fees. In addition, many events that offer continuing education units will provide them at no cost to the volunteers who staff the event.

### EMAIL CAMPAIGNS

There are numerous online platforms and websites designed for the purpose of creating and managing email lists. As fitness professionals build a business using an email list service, they can communicate directly with potential and existing clients. Email campaigns can be set up to distribute important information or to promote a sale on personal training programs. Most health club employers will currently be using email campaigns to communicate directly with club members, and it can benefit a Certified Personal Trainer to inquire about how to contribute content to better market services directly to club members. For independent fitness professionals, using an automated email service can be a highly beneficial tool to generate business.
