## Content
The last progression includes exercises that are designed to improve the rate of force production (power) and movement efficiency of the core musculature and extremities. These forms of exercise prepare an individual to dynamically stabilize and generate force at more functionallyÂ applicable (explosive) speeds (Butcher et al., 2007). Example exercises include (but are not limited to) the following:

	- Medicine ball rotation chest pass

	- Ball medicine ball pullover throw

	- Front medicine ball oblique throw

	- Side medicine ball oblique throw

	- Medicine ball soccer throw

	- Medicine ball woodchop throw

	- Medicine ball overhead throw

### FIVE KINETIC CHAIN CHECKPOINTS

As with any training method, proper form and technique must be mastered to ensure proper muscle activation and avoid injury. The skill for core training requires adequate focus and practice. Without inward focus and conscious attention to technique, injury may occur, especially as exercises become more explosive. Honing all skills with exquisite technique for each exercise is essential. Moreover, as with all exercises, improving quality should always come before increasing quantity or weight, and the five kinetic chain checkpoints should be monitored (**Figure 16-10**):

	- *Feet*: Approximately shoulder-width apart (when appropriate) and pointing straight ahead (when appropriate)

	- *Knees*: In line with the second and third toes (avoid allowing knees to cave inward)

	- *Hips*: Level and in a neutral position

	- *Shoulders*: Neutral position (not protracted or elevated)

	- *Head*: Cervical spine in a neutral position (chin tuck)
