# SUMMARY

The information presented up to this point in the text has focused on exercise considerations for apparently healthy adults. This chapter covered important information and recommendations for assessing and designing exercise programs for clients with selected chronic health conditions and functional limitations. Clients with chronic health conditions and functional limitations are a growing segment of society and the fitness industry. Roughly one-third of the worldâ€™s population is categorized as overweight or obese, and many more individuals contend with at least one chronic health condition every day. Additionally, client age impacts training decisions, as do other normal health scenarios, such as pregnancy. Researchers have shown that progressive exercise and increased physical activity can significantly improve the health and well-being of these various special populations. To serve the widest available clientele, it is highly important for fitness professionals to understand the intricacies of program design for a variety of populations. Fitness professionals are encouraged to continue to learn and expand their knowledge beyond working with apparently healthy populations. The field of clinical exercise physiology is rapidly growing, and fitness professionals are becoming an important part of that growth.

### CHAPTER REVIEW

This chapter presented exercise considerations for a variety of special populations and chronic health conditions. It is important to understand that there are fundamental physiologic differences between individuals who are apparently healthy and those with special conditions.

Although clients with special conditions may experience similar effects from exercise training as apparently healthy adults do, some do not respond, adapt, or progress the same way. Fitness professionals should be aware of important physiologic and health differences in their clients and how potential limiting factors will impact their response and adaptation to exercise.

Special populations discussed in this chapter include youth, older adults, and pregnant and postnatal clients. In addition, various chronic diseases were addressed including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, cancer, chronic lung disease, and intermittent claudication and PAD. It is important for the fitness professional to have a basic understanding of these special populations and chronic conditions to be able to adapt exercise routines to meet the unique needs of their clients.
