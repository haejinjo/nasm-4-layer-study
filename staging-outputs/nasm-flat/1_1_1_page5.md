## Content
To address the many physical and physiological needs of a client, an optimally designed fitness program should follow an integrated (i.e., comprehensive) approach. An integrated approach to exercise represents the inclusion of the following forms of training:

	- Flexibility and mobility

	- Core strength and stability

	- Cardiorespiratory (cardio)

	- Balance

	- Plyometrics

	- Speed, agility, and quickness

	- Resistance

NASM addressed the need for this integrated approach to training by developing the OPT model. The OPT model used in conjunction with evidence-based practice provides an exceptional pathway for designing safe and effective exercise programs. The advantage of the OPT model is that it is flexible, so it can be applied to any client with any fitness need in nearly any environment.
