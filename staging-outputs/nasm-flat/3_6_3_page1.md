# The Endocrine System

The term endocrine literally means “hormone secreting” (McArdle et al., 2016). Hormones produced by the endocrine system affect virtually all forms of human function, including triggering muscle contraction, stimulating protein and fat utilization (i.e., **lipolysis**), activating **enzyme** systems, regulating growth and metabolism, and determining the body’s physical and emotional response to stressors, such as exercise and injury (McArdle et al., 2016).

The endocrine system is a system that regulates a variety of bodily functions, including the control of mood, growth and development, tissue function, and metabolism. The endocrine system consists of host organs (known as **glands**), chemical messengers (**hormones**), and **target (receptor) cells**. Once a hormone is secreted from a gland, it travels through the bloodstream to target cells designed to receive its message.

The target cells have hormone-specific receptors, ensuring the hormone’s ability to bind with the cell and exert its intended action or function. As hormones travel the pathway from glands through the bloodstream, special proteins bind to some hormones, acting as both protectors and carriers (transporters) that control the amount of hormone that is available to interact with and affect the target cells (McArdle et al., 2016). The endocrine system is responsible for regulating multiple bodily functions to stabilize the body’s internal environment, much like a thermostat regulates the temperature in a room.

## Key Terms

**Lipolysis**
The breakdown and utilization of fat for energy.

**Enzyme**
A substance in the body that causes a specific reaction or change.

**Glands**
Organs that release substances into the bloodstream (such as hormones) or other surface of the body.

**Hormone**
Chemical messenger released from a gland that travels to cells to activate a specific function.

**Target (receptor) cell**
Cell that receives a message from a hormone or enzyme. Target cells exert an action after being stimulated or activated.
