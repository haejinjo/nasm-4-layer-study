#### CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

	- Flexibility is defined as the normal extensibility of all soft tissues that allows the complete ROM of a joint.

	- Flexibility has a major influence on mobility during dynamic motion.

	- Poor flexibility can lead to the development of relative flexibility, which is the process in which the HMS seeks the path of least resistance during functional movements.

	- The HMS, also known as the kinetic chain, comprises the muscular, skeletal, and nervous systems. The body’s kinetic chain can be further classified into two regional chains: upper kinetic chain and lower kinetic chain.

	- Muscle imbalance can be caused by postural distortions, repetitive movement, cumulative trauma, emotional duress, poor training technique, poor bodily control, and biased training patterns.

	- Muscle imbalance may result in altered reciprocal inhibition, synergistic dominance, and osteo- and arthrokinematic dysfunction.

	- Synergistic dominance is a neuromuscular phenomenon that occurs when synergists take over function for a weak or inhibited prime mover (agonist). This leads to altered reciprocal inhibition of the antagonist muscle.

	- Osteokinematics describes how the bones and joints are moving through a ROM, and arthrokinematics describes the motion at the joint surfaces. Altered joint motion can be caused by altered muscle length-tension relationships, force-couple relationships, and poor joint surface motion, which results in poor movement efficiency.

	- Neuromuscular efficiency is the ability of the nervous system to recruit the correct muscles to produce force, reduce force, and dynamically stabilize the body’s structure in all three planes of motion. To allow for optimal neuromuscular efficiency, individuals must have proper flexibility in all three planes of motion.

	- The scientific rationale for flexibility training is illustrated through the concept of pattern overload and the cumulative injury cycle.
