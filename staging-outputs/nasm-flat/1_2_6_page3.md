## Content
Additionally, after a trusted professional reputation has been built in the fitness industry, experienced fitness professionals can convert their industry contributions into CEUs for recertification. Industry contributions include writing articles for respected fitness magazines, creating content for fitness education programs, speaking at conferences, and presenting webinars. Because these can all be considered contributions that drive the industry forward, NASM and other certifying agencies recognize the effort involved and can provide CEUs on a case-by-case basis.

## Acquired Skills and Benefits

As previously mentioned, earning the NASM personal training credential is only the starting point of a fitness career. Continuing education programs provide additional learning opportunities about exercise program design to meet the needs of the extensive variety of clients a fitness professional can expect to encounter over the course of a career. As a Certified Personal Trainer progresses through their career, it will be important to focus on educational opportunities that not only satisfy the biannual recertification requirement but also function to drive that career forward.

### WORKING WITH NICHE POPULATIONS

Certain niche populations, such as youth athletes, active aging adults, and pre- and postnatal women, have special needs from an exercise program. Continuing education resources provide the learning opportunities for topics that can then be applied to niche client populations, helping to considerably expand a fitness professional’s book of business. Continuing education is like a toolbox: the more opportunities fitness professionals pursue, the more tools they have in their toolbox for a wide variety of situations. Acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to work with niche populations empowers a Certified Personal Trainer to work with more people than someone who only has a foundational credential.

### INCREASED PAY

When working for a commercial facility, one frequent benefit of completing continuing education is a higher pay rate, specifically when an advanced specialization or an additional certification is earned. Many facilities have tiered compensation programs, where a new Certified Personal Trainer typically earns a base rate when training clients. However, once an advanced specialization or additional certification is earned, that same fitness professional can be advanced to a higher tier and earn more per session. This can often compound, so that fitness professionals with numerous specializations or certifications end up earning far more than fitness professionals with only one certification. And for the independent fitness professional, the ability to cater to niche populations not only increases the number of clients one can work with but also allows the individual to potentially charge more per session.
