### ALIGNING WITH FOOD LABELS AND INGREDIENT LISTS

If clients have questions on how to select healthier products, then fitness professionals can direct them to the nutrition facts label and ingredients list, which are useful tools for evaluating the composition and nutritional value of food products. Clients can use the information provided in these items to assess the nutritional value of products, evaluating it in the context of their health and fitness goals. Clients with goals for weight management may benefit from choosing higher-fiber products and evaluating the calories, protein, and fat content of foods they select. Those with performance-based goals, and specific fueling needs, may want to look at the composition of a product as well as the amount of carbohydrate, fat, and protein provided in a serving. Athletes may wish to look at the electrolyte and carbohydrate composition of sports drinks and the composition of protein bars to determine if a product meets their fueling and performance requirements. The ingredients list and nutrition facts label on these products will enable them to make these evaluations and select products that best suit their needs and requirements.
