### SMR: Lateral Thigh

#### TECHNIQUE

The client is side-lying with the roller under the lateral thigh. The opposite hip and knee are bent with foot flat on the floor. Roll along the length of the lateral thigh. Avoid rolling over the hip or knee joint. This exercise can be too painful for some individuals. If this occurs, opt for a handheld roller instead.

### SMR: Tensor Fascia Latae

#### TECHNIQUE

The tensor fascia latae (TFL) is a small muscle, so this technique does not require lots of movement. To target the TFL, roll along the front and slightly lateral (outside) part of the upper thigh (just below the pelvis). Avoid rolling over the hip bone.

### SMR: Piriformis

#### TECHNIQUE

The piriformis is a small muscle of the posterior hip that runs horizontally across the pelvis. To target the piriformis, sit on top of the foam roll, positioned on the back of the hip. Cross one foot to the opposite knee and lean into the hip of the crossed leg. Roll back and forth over the muscle. Avoid rolling over the hip bone.
