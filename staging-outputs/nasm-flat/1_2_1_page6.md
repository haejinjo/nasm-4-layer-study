## Content
Working as an independent contractor allows a fitness professional to establish their own pay rates and earn the entire amount. However, keep in mind, this ultimately means a fitness professional is responsible for paying all the **operational costs**, such as fees to use a facility, marketing for new clients, continuing education, and benefits such as health care, time off, and automated income tax withholding. At first, it may seem tempting to work as an independent contractor because of the ability to earn more per session; however, when considering all of the costs and other administrative factors, it can be highly challenging for new fitness professionals. Certified Personal Trainers who train independently need savvy skills in sales, marketing, and business operations to ensure costs and profits are managed wisely.

Different facilities will have different arrangements for how fitness professionals can rent space, but generally, any fitness facility that allows independent contractors to meet with clients will require a formal agreement, including a monthly payment for the ability to rent space at that facility. It may be tempting to simply pay for a gym membership and offer personal training services directly to other club members, but that is “training under the table” and is considered a form of theft. A health club may prosecute fitness professionals for shoplifting or trespassing if they are caught. This violates the NASM Code of Professional Conduct and could also lead to the loss of the fitness professional's personal training credential. When entering into a contract with a facility, fitness professionals should make sure that all expectations from the manager or owner are clearly identified and communicated in writing.

#### TRAINING TIP

There are many factors to consider before a fitness professional makes the choice to work as an independent contractor, including the following:

	- When searching for a facility to rent space, fitness professionals should pay close attention to how the staff treats existing members. It can be difficult to market personal training services in facilities that do not provide an exceptional service experience.

	- If the plan is to work directly with clients in their homes, a fitness professional should take the time to research the local market to see if it can support that business. Costs such as gasoline, vehicle maintenance, and time driving place to place should also be considered.

	- A fitness professional should identify marketing expenses required to attract clients. It takes a lot of time and effort to develop a marketing strategy that can attract a steady stream of customers.

	- A fitness professional should budget for purchasing liability insurance. When working for an employer, a fitness professional is covered under an employer’s liability insurance. However, when working as an independent contractor, fitness professionals must purchase their own liability insurance to protect their personal assets in case of a lawsuit.

### SMALL GROUP TRAINING

From providing a more affordable price point for coach-led workouts, to a more enjoyable participant experience, a number of factors have led to the growth of group workouts, also called small group training or group personal training. Traditional group exercise classes, such as dance aerobics and indoor cycling, can include upward of 30 or more participants. Conversely, group personal training programs feature workouts for smaller groups of individuals who can be coached by an individual fitness professional. There are a number of branded fitness studios offering a variety of group training concepts ranging from **high-intensity interval training (HIIT)** sessions and boot camps to custom group workouts for special populations (e.g., older adults, youths). Because group personal training requires a different skill set than leading a single individual through a workout, fitness professionals are encouraged to pursue additional education to develop the necessary communication and coaching skills to lead group training programs.
