# Hypertension

Blood pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. It varies with the strength of the heartbeat, the elasticity of the arterial walls, the volume and viscosity of the blood, and a person’s health, age, and physical condition. **Hypertension**, or high blood pressure, is a common medical disorder in which arterial blood pressure is above 120 mm Hg for systolic and 80 mm Hg for diastolic. A client is considered to have hypertension if their blood pressure measurements, obtained on at least 2 different occasions, are above normal or if they are currently taking medication to control blood pressure. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recently released updated blood pressure guidelines (American College of Cardiology, 2017). The revised guidelines state the following:

	- Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg.

	- Elevated blood pressure is 120–129 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 80 mm Hg (diastolic).

	- Stage 1 hypertension is 130–139 mm Hg (systolic) or 80–89 mm Hg (diastolic).

	- Stage 2 hypertension is 140 mm Hg or higher (systolic) or 90 mm Hg or higher (diastolic).

	- A hypertensive crisis is greater than 180 mm Hg (systolic) and/or 120 mm Hg or higher (diastolic).

Some of the most common causes of hypertension include smoking, sedentary living, alcohol abuse, and excess weight. The health risks of hypertension are well known and include increased risk for **stroke**, cardiovascular disease, **heart failure**, and **kidney failure**.

One of the most common and traditional methods of controlling hypertension is through antihypertensive medications (Khera et al., 2018). Although medications have been shown to be highly effective, comprehensive lifestyle changes, including regular physical activity, healthy eating, and smoking cessation, have also been shown to reduce blood pressure, potentially eliminating the need for medications or lending to reduced dosing (Ghadieh & Saab, 2015).

Research has shown that exercise can have a modest impact on lowering elevated blood pressure by an average of 10–20 mm Hg for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Börjesson et al., 2015). Exercise may help the body produce more appropriate responses to physical activity or other physiologic stressors. The changes appear modest, but any lowering of blood pressure conveys a lowered overall health risk, which is important. Low to moderately intense cardiorespiratory exercise has been shown to be just as effective as high-intensity activity in reducing blood pressure (Costa et al., 2018). This is important for elderly or obese individuals with high blood pressure and who are not physically capable of performing high-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise.

It is also important to emphasize the importance of an overall plan to reduce blood pressure that includes exercise, diet, weight loss (if appropriate), and most important, compliance with any medical treatment plans if clients are under the care of a physician. Fitness professionals are encouraged to stress to all of their clients the importance of taking any prescribed medications.

Fitness professionals should evaluate their client’s heart rate response to exercise, as measured during a submaximal exercise test or even during a simple assessment of heart rate during a comfortable exercise load. Individuals with hypertension frequently take medications that can alter the heart rate response to exercise, in most cases blunting the heart rate response to exercise, thus invalidating prediction equations or estimates of training heart rate. Fitness professionals are also encouraged to learn how to accurately assess both resting and exercise blood pressure with all of their clients but especially those clients with hypertension. Classes to learn how to take blood pressure measurements are available through local healthcare organizations or hospitals.

## Key Terms

**Hypertension**
Consistently elevated blood pressure.

**Stroke**
A sudden lack of blood supply to the brain, caused by either a blockage in an artery or ruptured blood vessel.

**Heart failure**
A condition in which the heart can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs.

**Kidney failure**
A sudden condition in which the kidneys cannot sufficiently filter waste from the blood and leads to renal failure.
