## Content
An exercise leader has a unique opportunity to make a positive impact on large or small groups of people and to help foster a cohesive group environment. Aside from bringing a group together, the exercise leader should also be able to reach individual participants with simple gestures like making eye contact, smiling, and giving positive verbal feedback. With the goal of making everyone feel included, it is also necessary to demonstrate exercise modifications so that people with varying skills can all be challenged within a single session. The exercise leader is an important person for clients to emulate because that person demonstrates the exercises, helps set goals, and shows that exercise can be done consistently (Morton et al., 2019). Exercise leaders should be aware that because members pay close attention to what they are doing and how they approach exercise, it is important to be a positive role model and send appropriate verbal and nonverbal messages.

#### TRY THIS

Certified Personal Trainers may be expected to provide recommendations for clients regarding which group exercise classes are the best to attend. Consequently, Certified Personal Trainers should be knowledgeable about different class formats and the instructors who teach them. All fitness professionals should consider taking a variety of classes to learn more about various exercise formats and instruction styles. This will help match clients to classes and instructors that best suit their needs and personalities.

### THE EXERCISE GROUP

The idea of an exercise group has become common in the fitness industry along with the growing popularity of exercise sessions coached by certified professionals. The exercise group consists of the participants who are present for a given class or session. With many people drawn to certain types of exercise and who follow consistent schedules, it is common to see the same faces for group exercise sessions. Oftentimes, a good exercise leader will develop a following, and an exercise group will form. One aspect of an exercise group is feeling distinct from others; fitness professionals can encourage this simply by having participants wear the same color shirt or having the group come together at the end of a session for a group cheer or any other ritual that is specific to that group.

While the overall influence held by a group over exercise behavior is still not fully understood, there is a general consensus that being a part of a group has a positive effect (Evans et al., 2019b). People simply exercising together may not necessarily identify as a group, because groups have distinct characteristics and the members often have formal or informal roles. A formal role would be held by the exercise leader or coach from whom instruction and organization are expected.
