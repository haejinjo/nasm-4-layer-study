## Content
The next progression involves jumps with more amplitude and dynamic motion. The speed of the jumps is also progressed. These exercises are intended to improve dynamic joint stabilization, eccentric strength, rate of force production, and coordination of the entire human body. These exercises are performed in a repetitive fashion, spending a relatively short amount of time on the ground before repeating the drill. In other words, the client will no longer hold the landing position for 3â€“5 seconds but instead initiate another jump upon landing using a moderate (repeating) tempo. Some example exercises using this protocol include (but are not limited to) the following:

	- Squat jump

	- Tuck jump

	- Butt kick

	- Power step-up

The last progression includes exercises that involve explosive, powerful movements. These exercises are designed to further improve rate of force production, eccentric strength, and reactive joint stabilization. These exercises are performed as fast and as explosively as possible. Some example exercises using this protocol include (but are not limited to) the following:

	- Ice skaters (also known as skater jumps)

	- Single-leg power step-up

	- Proprioceptive plyometrics

	- Depth jump
