## Content
Dietary protein, however, provides an important contribution to the body’s amino acid pool, especially for the nine essential amino acids. Inadequate and imbalanced protein intake can compromise the availability of adequate essential amino acids for protein synthesis. Some amino acids can become conditionally essential under certain circumstances, such as growth, high-volume training, and illness and/or injury (**Table 9-4**). For example, arginine and histidine can become conditionally essential under high-volume training or metabolic stress. Glutamine may become conditionally essential in circumstances that involve issues in the gastrointestinal tract.

## Dietary Protein

Dietary protein is protein that has been obtained through food sources. Most foods, except fruits and oils, contain some amount of protein. Meat, dairy, eggs, poultry, fish, legumes (e.g., peas, beans, lentils), soy, vegetables, and grains provide amino acids that are used to build proteins in the body. Some foods may be better sources of protein than others in that they provide all of the essential amino acids and are more easily digested and absorbed than other sources. A protein source is considered to be a **complete protein **if it provides all of the essential amino acids, whereas an **incomplete protein **is lacking in one or more of the essential amino acids. In general, proteins from animal sources (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy) as well as soy and hemp protein are considered to be complete (Hoffman & Falvo, 2004). Legumes, grains, and vegetables are considered incomplete protein sources since on their own they do not provide all the essential amino acids (Food and Drug Administration, 2018) (**Table 9-5**).

## Key Terms

**Complete protein**
A protein source that provides all essential amino acids.

**Incomplete protein**
A protein that lacks one or more of the amino acids required to build cells.
