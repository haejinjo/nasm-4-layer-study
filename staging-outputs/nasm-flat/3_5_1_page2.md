## Content
# Introduction to the Human Movement System

Human movement is accomplished through the functional integration of three systems within the human body: the nervous system, the skeletal system, and the muscular system. These three systems are interdependent and must work together to produce human movement (Chu et al., 2016). If one component of the **human movement system (HMS)** is not working properly, it will affect the other systems and ultimately affect movement (Sueki et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important that fitness professionals understand how the systems work together, forming a **kinetic chain** to produce efficient movement.

## Expectations for the Fitness Professional

The fitness professional must have a working knowledge of anatomy and physiology to administer an accurate fitness assessment, program safe exercises, and answer any questions the client may have regarding their fitness program. For example, the client may have questions regarding which muscles are involved in a specific exercise or the physiological benefits of cardiovascular training. To accurately answer a variety of client questions, as well as better understand why exercise techniques work the way they do, fitness professionals need a foundational understanding of the structure and function of the nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems.

## Key Terms

**Human movement system (HMS)**
The collective components and structures that work together to move the body: muscular, skeletal, and nervous systems.

**Kinetic chain**
A concept that describes the human body as a chain of interdependent links that work together to perform movement.
