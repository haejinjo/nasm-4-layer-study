# Common Barriers to Exercise

Despite the overwhelming evidence showing that regular exercise is associated with many physical and psychological benefits, barriers to participation are often cited by sedentary or infrequently active individuals. Barriers to exercise are common for nearly everyone at one time or another due to busy lifestyles that include family responsibilities, work obligations, and social commitments. In fact, barriers are often in direct competition with motivations to exercise. A barrier is anything that prevents someoneâ€™s ability to exercise, whether it is a one-time or regular occurrence.

Some barriers are physical, such as illness, injury, lack of transportation, or a lack of a safe place to exercise. Other barriers are based in perception, such as the belief of not having enough time or energy to exercise. People with perception barriers may feel like they are physical, and in some situations they can be (e.g., a single parent balancing a career and raising children), but many can be addressed with better time-management skills and setting a daily priority on health.

The role of the fitness professional is to help clients determine their personal barriers and help them strategize ways to overcome them. Clients also need to have a plan to deal with unexpected barriers that may occur, such as needing to stay late at work, forgetting to pack workout attire, or not having childcare. Barriers will be a constant battle for some, so helping clients determine their personal barriers and how to overcome them will help with overall exercise adherence.

Barriers will also change as people age and as responsibilities shift. For example, young adults may not have children or significant job responsibilities; as people age, demands on their time may shift after having children and taking on more responsibilities at work. Women, in particular, have indicated that parenthood is a major barrier to exercise; its significance grew along with an increasing number of children (El Ansari & Lovell, 2009). By contrast, older adults may be facing barriers such as health issues, availability of appealing facilities, and cost of participation (Gray et al., 2016). Fitness professionals should check in frequently with their clients to reassess barriers and strategize ways to overcome them.
