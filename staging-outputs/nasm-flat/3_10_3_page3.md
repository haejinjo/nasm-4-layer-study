## Content
Vitamin K is often suggested to be supplemented with vitamin D and calcium for bone health. In general, vitamin D helps deposit calcium in bones, and vitamin K helps increase bone protein content and improve strength, which also decreases risk of fracture (Bolton-Smith et al., 2007; Lanham-New, 2008). Perhaps of greater importance, vitamin K may help direct calcium deposition to bones instead of the vasculature, potentially decreasing the risk of coronary heart disease (Shea et al., 2009).

Vitamin K deficiencies are very rare and tend to only occur in infants or those with malabsorption disorders. Low vitamin K status only becomes clinically relevant when it is low enough to reduce blood clotting times and leads to excessive bleeding. Vitamin K is not known to produce toxicities, but it does have negative interactions with warfarin and other anticoagulant drugs, which can cause dangerous excessive bleeding.

### WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS

The water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C and the B complex vitamins (**Figure 10-5**). They dissolve more easily and can be readily absorbed by the body, but they are not stored and must be consumed more regularly to maintain consistent levels. The water-soluble vitamins are mostly present in dietary supplements in their bioactive form.

#### CRITICAL

Compared to the fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins are more transient, which means they are less likely to produce a vitamin toxicity, and it is easier to treat acute deficiencies.

The active form of vitamin C is L-ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is required for **collagen** synthesis, protein metabolism, and the regeneration of glutathione, the bodyâ€™s primary antioxidant. There is also some evidence to suggest that vitamin C may have effects on immune function. For example, increasing the vitamin C intake in athletes has shown about a 50% reduction in the incidence of common colds as well as shorter duration and reduced severity (Constantini et al., 2011; Peters et al., 1993; Van Straten & Josling, 2002).

While high-dose vitamin C supplementation has become fairly common, the body is proficient at regulating vitamin C absorption. At normal doses of vitamin C near the recommended DV, most is absorbed.

## Key Terms

**Collagen**
A protein found in connective tissue, muscles, and skin that provides strength and structure. It is the most abundant protein in the human body.
