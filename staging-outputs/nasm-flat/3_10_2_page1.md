# Supplementation Guidelines  and Labels

Despite claims that dietary supplements are an unregulated industry, the FDA enforces guidelines for dietary supplements in the United States. **The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994** as well as the FDAâ€™s **Code of Federal Regulations** are the primary laws and guidelines to which dietary supplements, their manufacturers, and their distributors must adhere. In Europe, dietary supplements are regulated by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Union (EU) general food law, specifically directive 2002/46/EC. In Australia, dietary supplements are considered complementary medicines, and they are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. In Canada, dietary supplements are referred to as natural health products, and they are regulated by the Food and Drugs Act by Health Canada.

Dietary supplements are required to be natural or, at least, present in nature. They may be synthetic, but they may only be synthetic if the synthetic material produced is a replica of a natural substance. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is naturally present in citrus fruits and other foods, but most vitamin C supplements contain a synthetically produced ascorbic acid.

## General Guidelines for Responsible Use

Supplements have the potential to improve health, performance, and other desirable attributes, but they also have the potential to do harm when used inappropriately. By their nature, dietary supplements are not meant to be used as substitutes for food; this includes protein powders, which are intended to help increase the protein content of the diet, not serve as a replacement source for all protein in the diet.
