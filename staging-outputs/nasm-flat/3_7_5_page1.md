## Content
## Muscular Force

**Force** is defined as the interaction between two entities or bodies that results in either the acceleration or deceleration of an object. Forces are characterized by magnitude (how much) and direction (which way they are moving) (Hamill & Knutzen, 2003; Levangie et al., 2019). The HMS is designed to manipulate variable forces from many directions to effectively produce movement. As such, the fitness professional must gain an understanding of some of the more pertinent forces that the HMS must deal with and how they affect motion.

## Length-Tension Relationships

A **length-tension relationship** refers to the association between the **resting length** of a muscle and the amount of internal tension it can produce at that resting length (Levangie et al., 2019). Each muscle in the body has an optimal muscle length at which the **actin** and **myosinÂ **filaments within the **sarcomere** have the greatest degree of overlap (**Figure 7-15**). At that optimal length, the ability of myosin to make a maximal amount of connections with actin results in the potential for maximal force production of that muscle.

At both extremes of muscle shortening or lengthening there is a diminished ability to produce force. When a muscle has chronically low neural activation and is longer than it should be, there is a reduced amount of actin and myosin overlap, reducing the amount of force that can be produced at that length. When a muscle has chronically high neural activation and is regularly held in a contracted (shortened) state, it places the actin and myosin in a state of maximal overlap and allows for no further movement to occur between the filaments, also reducing its force output potential (Levangie et al., 2019).

## Key Terms

**Force**
An influence applied by one object to another, which results in an acceleration or deceleration of the second object.

**Length-tension relationship**
The resting length of a muscle and the tension the muscle can produce at this resting length.

**Resting length**
The length of a muscle when it is not actively contracting or being stretched.

**Actin**
The thin, stringlike, myofilament that acts along with myosin to produce muscular contraction.

**Myosin**
The thick myofilament that acts along with actin to produce muscular contraction.

**Sarcomere**
The structural unit of a myofibril composed of actin and myosin filaments between two Z-lines.
