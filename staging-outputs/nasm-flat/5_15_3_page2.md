## Content
The cardiorespiratory portion of a warm-up period consists of whole-body, dynamic cardi­orespiratory or muscular movements (well below the anticipated training intensity threshold for conditioning). The purpose of the warm-up period is to increase heart and respiration rates, increase tissue temperature, and psychologically prepare the individual for higher training in­tensities (Mcgowan et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2018).

### SUGGESTED WARM-UP ACTIVITIES

NASM recommends that the cardiorespiratory portion of a warm-up last between 5 and 10 min­utes and be performed at a low- to moderate-intensity level. However, depending on the client’s goals and objectives, these recommendations can be modified by either extending or reducing the time allotted to the warm-up period or by modifying activities based on any known or sus­pected medical or physical limitations a client may have.

New clients who are sedentary or have medical limitations or those with limited previous exercise experience may require more of their dedicated workout time be directed to warm-up activities, at least initially.

Moreover, a comprehensive warm-up should also include a combination of flexibility techniques in addition to cardiorespiratory exercise. Flexibility exercises include self-myofascial techniques (i.e., foam rolling), static stretching, active stretching, and dynamic stretching.

It is vitally important that fitness professionals have a comprehensive understanding of safe and effective flexibility exercises. Fitness professionals should begin each training session with new clients by explaining the benefits to be gained from each new flexibility technique followed by a demonstration of each new exercise, emphasizing safety and proper technique. Once a client has demonstrated a complete understanding of flexibility techniques and operation of the cardiorespiratory equipment, they can begin performing the warm-up before the session with the fitness professional. This will then allow for increased training time in which to focus on other aspects of the training program.

#### TRAINING TIP

Flexibility techniques used during a client’s warm-up should target muscles that have been identified as overactive during the assessment process. Consequently, fitness professionals should conduct a comprehensive fitness evaluation, including posture and movement assessments, prior to designing a client’s exercise program. Posture and movement assessments are discussed in Chapter 12.

It should be emphasized that the warm-up period should prepare the body for activity; thus, it is important to monitor the intensity at which clients are performing selected warm-up ac­tivities to ensure they do not unduly fatigue before the workout portion of their program begins. Keeping the activity to a moderate duration and intensity level will help ensure a proper warm-up. **Table 15-6 **provides example warm-up activities for a new client.
