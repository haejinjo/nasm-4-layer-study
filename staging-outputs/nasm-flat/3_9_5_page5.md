## Hydration Strategies

Water is an essential nutrient and vital to sustain life. It comprises approximately 60% of most adult bodies. Women may have a slightly lower percentage, and some men may have a slightly higher percentage of body water due to higher glycogen stores.

Water serves several important functions in the body, including the following:

	- Regulation of body temperature

	- Transport and distribution of water-soluble nutrients 

	- Maintenance of blood volume

	- Lubrication of joints, membranes, and synovial tissue

	- Shock absorption

	- Removal of waste matter and toxins

Inadequate fluid intake can impair many physiologic functions as well as cognitive processes. Even mild dehydration can lead to a decline in function and affect performance and recovery for athletes and exercisers. The recommended amount of fluid intake for most men and women is around 11.5 cups per day (2.7 L) for women and around 15.5 cups (3.7 L) for men (Institute of Medicine, 2005). Exercise and certain conditions and circumstances, such as illness, pregnancy, breast-feeding, warm weather, altitude, and dietary increases in protein and fiber, can also influence a client’s daily fluid requirements (**Figure 9-6**).

#### STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

While the water content in certain foods consumed may contribute to a client’s hydration status, the effort to consume these water-rich foods for the sake of hydration may require exponential effort compared to simply consuming a glass of water. Some common foods containing a minimum of 90% water include, but are not restricted to, strawberries, cantaloupe, cucumbers, lettuce, zucchini, celery, and tomatoes.

### WATER AND PERFORMANCE

Clients lacking hydration will show signs of impaired performance due to multiple adverse effects. Inadequate hydration, and even a mild level of dehydration, can have the following negative effects on the body and on athletic performance:

	- Increased heart rate

	- Higher body temperature

	- Higher rate of perceived exertion

	- Increased use of muscle glycogen

	- Lower blood volume

	- Decreased cardiac output

	- Decreased blood flow

	- Lower rate of perspiration (and temperature regulation)
