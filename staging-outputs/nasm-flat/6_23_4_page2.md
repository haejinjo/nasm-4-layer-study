## Content
It is important to monitor the body position of clients with hypertension at all times throughout an exercise training session. As with obese and diabetic clients, body position can have a dramatic effect on blood pressure response before, during, and after exercise in clients with hypertension. Supine or prone positions (especially when the head is lower in elevation than the heart) can often increase blood pressure, and as such, these positions may be contraindicated. For example, a standing cable hip extension (**Figure 23: -3**) exercise may be more appropriate than a floor bridge (**Figure 23: -4**) for strengthening the gluteals. It is important to note that both hypotensive and hypertensive responses to exercise are possible in clients with hypertension, especially when taking into account the effects of medication, body position, and exercise selection.

When assessing clients with hypertension, fitness professionals should follow the guidelines in Chapters 11 and 12. Moreover, exercises should be performed primarily in a seated or standing position (**Tables 23-10 **and **23-11**). While clients may use a variety of flexibility techniques, static and active stretching may be the easiest and safest. Foam rolling performed on the floor may be contraindicated because it requires lying down. A cardiorespiratory program of continuous, lower-intensity (50–85% of work capacity) aerobic exercise is initially recommended and should progress only after a physician’s approval.
